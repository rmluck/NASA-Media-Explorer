SIRTF will carry three versatile instruments to analyze the radiation it collects, the Multiband Imaging Photometer, the Infrared Array Camera, and the Infrared Spectrograph. SIRTF long lifetime - 5 years or more - will permit astronomers of all disciplines to use the facililty to carry out a wide variety of astrophysical programs.

The 14-Inch Wind Tunnel is a trisonic wind tunnel. This means it is capable of running subsonic, below the speed of sound; transonic, at or near the speed of sound (Mach 1, 760 miles per hour at sea level); or supersonic, greater than Mach 1 up to Mach 5. It is an intermittent blowdown tunnel that operates by high pressure air flowing from storage to either vacuum or atmospheric conditions. The MSFC 14x14-Inch Trisonic Wind Tunnel has been an integral part of the development of the United States space program Rocket and launch vehicles from the Jupiter-C in 1958, through the Saturn family up to the current Space Shuttle and beyond have been tested in this Wind Tunnel. MSFC's 14x14-Inch Trisonic Wind Tunnel, as with most other wind tunnels, is named after the size of the test section. The 14-Inch Wind Tunnel, as in the past, will continue to play a large but unseen role in the development of America's space program.", "keywords": ["14x14-Inch Trisonic Wind Tunnel", "Marshall Space Flight Center", "MSFC"], "center": "MSFC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1988-01-01T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/8891417/8891417~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/8891417/8891417~thumb.jpg"}
