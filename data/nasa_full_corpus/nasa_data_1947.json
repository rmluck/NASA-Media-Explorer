In 1942 the Bell XP-59A Airacomet became the first jet aircraft in the US. The Airacomet incorporated centrifugal turbojet engines that were based on British plans secretly brought to the US in 1941. A Bell test pilot flew the XP-59A for the first time at Muroc Lake, California in October 1942. The General Electric I-16 engines proved to be problematic. In an effort to increase the engine performance, an Airacomet was secretly brought to Cleveland in early 1944 for testing in the Altitude Wind Tunnel. A series of tunnel investigations in February and March resulted in a 25-percent increase in the I-16 engine\u2019s performance. Nonetheless, Bell\u2019s 66 Airacomets never made it into combat.    A second, slightly improved Airacomet, a P-59B, was transferred to NACA Lewis just after the war in September 1945. The P-59B was used over the next three years to study general jet thrust performance and thrust augmentation devices such as afterburners and water/alcohol injection. The P-59B flights determined the proper alcohol and water mixture and injection rate to produce a 21-percent increase in thrust. Since the extra boost would be most useful for takeoffs, a series of ground-based tests with the aircraft ensued. It was determined that the runway length for takeoffs could be reduced by as much as 15 percent. The P-59B used for the tests is now on display at the Air Force Museum at Wright Patterson.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1947-03-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1947-C-18108/GRC-1947-C-18108~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1947-C-18108/GRC-1947-C-18108~thumb.jpg"}

The military understood that the TG-180 would not be ready during World War II but recognized the axial-flow compressor\u2019s long-term potential. Although the engine was bench tested in April 1944, it was not flight tested until February 1946.    The TG-180 was brought to the Altitude Wind Tunnel in 1945 for a series of investigations. The studies, which continued intermittently into 1948, analyzed an array of performance issues. NACA modifications steadily improved the TG-180\u2019s performance, including the first successful use of an afterburner. The Lewis researchers studied a 29-inch diameter afterburner over a range of altitude conditions using several different types of flameholders and fuel systems. Lewis researchers concluded that a three-stage flameholder with its largest stage upstream was the best burner configuration.    Although the TG-180 (also known as the J35) was not the breakthrough engine that the military had hoped for, it did power the Douglas D-558-I Skystreak to a world speed record on August 20, 1947.

NACA Lewis conducted a wide variety of studies on ramjets to determine basic operational data necessary to design missiles. This information included the relationship between combustion chamber and inlet pressure and temperature, velocity of the fuel-air ratio to the ignition characteristics, and combustion efficiency. Although wind tunnel and test stand studies were important first steps in determining these factors, actual flight tests were required.    Lewis engineers modified the B-29 so that the ramjet could be stored in the bomb bay. Once the aircraft reached the desired altitude and speed the ramjet was suspended 52 inches below the bomb bay. The ramjet\u2019s angle-of-attack could be independently adjusted, and a periscope permitted a view of the test article from inside the aircraft. Measurements were taken in free-stream conditions between 5,000 and 30,000 feet.   The test flights, which began in April 1947, were flown at speeds up to Mach 0.51 and altitudes of 5,000 to 30,000 feet. The researchers first determined that 14,000 feet was the maximum altitude at which the engine could be ignited by spark. Flares were used to start the engine at altitudes up to 30,000 feet. Overall the ramjet operated well at all speeds and altitudes.

It was designed so the crew could perform their flight and tracking tasks in complete darkness.     NACA Lewis was in the midst of a massive research effort on ramjets when it acquired the Black Widow. Researchers used the aircraft to accelerate the ramjet until it reached a velocity at which it could be ignited. A ramjet can be seen being fired underneath the aircraft in this photograph. Sensors and instrumentation fed data from the ramjet to the pilot and researchers on the ground.     The NACA researchers created a rectangular ramjet with a V-shaped gutter flameholder. The researchers installed the ramjet on the P-61 and flew it at subsonic speeds over a range of altitudes up to 29,000 feet. The ramjet had been previously tested at low speeds on a test stand on the hangar apron. The rectangular ramjet was also used to study different types of flameholders and nozzles used to spray fuel into the combustion chamber. The Black Widow was transferred from Lewis in October 1948.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1947-01-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1947-C-17743/GRC-1947-C-17743~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1947-C-17743/GRC-1947-C-17743~thumb.jpg"}

The Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory conducted a wide variety of studies on ramjets in the 1940s and 1960s to determine the basic operational data necessary to design missiles. Although wind tunnel and test stand investigations were important first steps in determining these factors, actual flight tests were required. Lewis possessed several aircraft for the ramjet studies, including North American F-82 Mustangs, a Northrup P-61 Black Widow, and a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was used for this particular ramjet. This was Lewis\u2019 first flight at over the experimental testing ground at Wallops Island. The NACA\u2019s Langley laboratory established the station on the Virginia coast in 1945 to conduct early missile tests.    This ramjet-powered missile was affixed underneath the B-29\u2019s left wing and flown up to 29,000 feet. The ramjet was ignited as the aircraft reached Mach 0.5 and released.  The flight went well, but a problem with the data recording prevented a successful mission. Nonetheless additional flights in November 1947 provided researchers with data on the engine\u2019s combustion efficiency at different levels of fuel-air ratios, thrust coefficients, temperatures, and drag. Transonic flight data such as the rapid acceleration through varying flight conditions could not be easily captured in wind tunnels.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1947-07-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1947-C-19067/GRC-1947-C-19067~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1947-C-19067/GRC-1947-C-19067~thumb.jpg"}

The aircraft\u2019s nose art, visible in this photograph, includes a leather-jacketed mechanic with an extinguisher fleeing a fiery woman.   North American developed the B-25 in the mid-1930s as a transport aircraft, but it was hurriedly reconfigured as a medium bomber for World War II. This XB-25E was a single prototype designed in 1942 specifically to test an exhaust gas ice prevention system developed by NACA researcher Lewis Rodert.  The system circulated the engines\u2019 hot bleed air to the wings, windshield, and tail. The XB-25E was utilized at the NACA\u2019s Ames Aeronautical Laboratory for two years before being transferred to Cleveland in July 1944.  NACA Lewis mechanics modified the aircraft further by installing electrical heating in the front fuselage, propellers, inboard sing, cowls, and antennae.    Lewis pilots flew the B-24M and XB-25E into perilous weather conditions all across the country to study both deicing technologies and the physics of ice-producing clouds.

There were a series of stops on the tour, mostly at test facilities, where researchers would brief the group on the latest efforts in their particular field. The Inspections grew in size and scope over the years and by the mid-1940s required multiple days.    The three-day 1947 Inspection was the first time the event was held at NACA Lewis. Over 800 scientists, industrialists, and military leaders attended the three-day event. Talks were given at the Altitude Wind Tunnel, Four Burner Area, Engine Research Building, and other facilities. An array of topics were discussed, including full-scale engine testing, ramjets, axial-flow compressors, turbojets, fuels, icing, and materials. The NACA Lewis staff and their families were able to view the same presentations after the Inspection was over.   Sloop, a researcher in the Fuels and Thermodynamics Division, briefed visitors on NACA Lewis\u2019 early research in rocket engine propellants, combustion, and cooling.

The wind tunnel was such a success in the mid-1940s that there was a backlog of engines waiting to be tested. The Four Burner chambers were quickly built in 1946 and 1947 to ease the Altitude Wind Tunnel\u2019s congested schedule.    The Four Burner Area was located in the southwest wing of the massive Engine Research Building, across the road from the Altitude Wind Tunnel. The two chambers were 10 feet in diameter and 60 feet long. The refrigeration equipment produced the temperatures and the exhauster equipment created the low pressures present at altitudes up to 60,000 feet.    In 1947 the Rolls Royce Nene was the first engine tested in the new facility. The mechanic in this photograph is installing a General Electric J-35 engine. Over the next ten years, a variety of studies were conducted using the General Electric J-47 and Wright Aeronautical J-65 turbojets. The two test cells were occasionally used for rocket engines between 1957 and 1959, but other facilities were better suited to the rocket engine testing. The Four Burner Area was shutdown in 1959.
