During World War II the ordnance works produced trinitroluene (TNT), dinitrotoluene (DNT), and pentolite which were crated and shipped to an arsenal in Ravenna, Ohio. There, the explosives were packed into shells and sent to Allied forces overseas. Plum Brook was the third largest producer of TNT during World War II.     Toluene, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid were used to manufacture the TNT. Nitric Acid is made by oxidizing ammonia, adding water, and concentrating it. The facility in this photograph was used for this oxidation. The structure included air compressors, filters, aftercoolers, power recovery systems, air receivers, heaters, ammonia gasifiers, gas mixers, cooler condensers, absorption columns, and bleaching columns.    The Plum Brook Ordnance Works was shut down immediately after the war and remained vacant for the next ten years. NASA\u2019s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), acquired the 500 acres of the site in 1955 to build a nuclear test reactor. By 1963, the agency had acquired the entire 9000 acres from the Army. Almost all of the military facilities were removed in the early 1960s. Plum Brook Station contained over 30 test facilities at its peak in the late 1960s. Today there are four major facilities in operation.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1943-06-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-2004-C-00105/GRC-2004-C-00105~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-2004-C-00105/GRC-2004-C-00105~thumb.jpg"}

When it was built at the in the early 1940s the AWT was among the most complex test facilities ever designed. It was the first wind tunnel capable of operating full-scale engines under realistic flight conditions. This simulation included the reduction of air temperature, a decrease in air pressure, and the creation of an airstream velocity of up to 500 miles per hour.  The AWT was constructed in 1942 and 1943. This photograph shows NACA engineers Lou Hermann and Jack Aust assembling the tunnel\u2019s drive fan inside the hangar. The 12-bladed, 31-foot-diameter spruce wood fan would soon be installed inside the wind tunnel to create the high-speed airflow. This massive propeller was designed and constructed by the engine lab's design team at Langley Field. John Breisch, a Langley technician with several years of wind tunnel installation experience, arrived in Cleveland at the time of this photograph to supervise the fan assembly inside the hangar. He would return several weeks later to oversee the actual installation in the tunnel. The fan was driven at 410 revolutions per minute by an 18,000-horsepower General Electric induction motor that was located in the rear corner of the Exhauster Building. An extension shaft connected the motor to the fan. A bronze screen protected the fan against damage from failed engine parts sailing through the tunnel. Despite this screen the blades did become worn or cracked over time and had to be replaced. An entire new fan was installed in 1951.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1943-07-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-01849/GRC-1943-C-01849~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-01849/GRC-1943-C-01849~thumb.jpg"}

The military loaned the B\u201326B to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to augment the lab\u2019s studies of the Wright Aeronautical R\u20132800 engines. The military wanted to improve the engine cooling in order to increase the bomber\u2019s performance. On March 17, 1943, the B\u201326B performed the very first research flight at the NACA\u2019s new engine laboratory.   The B\u201326B received its \u201cWidowmaker\u201d nickname during the rushed effort to transition the new aircraft from design to production and into the sky. During World War II, however, the B\u201326B proved itself to be a capable war machine. The U.S. lost fewer Marauders than any other type of bomber employed in the war. The B\u201326B was originally utilized at low altitudes in the Pacific but had its most success at high altitudes over Europe.    The B\u201326B\u2019s flight tests in Cleveland during 1943 mapped the R-2800 engine\u2019s behavior at different altitudes and speeds. The researchers were then able to correlate engine performance in ground facilities to expected performance at different altitudes. They found that air speed, cowl flap position, angle of attack, propeller thrust, and propeller speed influenced inlet pressure recovery and exhaust distribution. The flight testing proceeded quickly, and the B\u201326B was transferred elsewhere in October 1943.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1943-09-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-02280/GRC-1943-C-02280~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-02280/GRC-1943-C-02280~thumb.jpg"}

The engine, which was developed for commercial applications in 1939, was used to power the North American B\u201325 bomber and several other midsize military aircraft. The higher altitudes required by the military caused problems with the engine's cooling and fuel systems.        The military requested that the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory analyze the performance of the R\u20132600, improve its cooling system, and reduce engine knock. The NACA researchers subjected the engine to numerous tests in its Prop House. The R\u20132600 was the subject of the laboratory's first technical report, which was written by members of the Fuels and Lubricants Division.    The Prop House contained soundproof test cells in which piston engines and propellers were mounted and operated at high powers. Electrically driven fans drew air through ducts to create a stream of cooling air over the engines.

The AWT was capable of operating full-scale engines in air density, speed, and temperature similar to that found at high altitudes. The tunnel could produce wind speeds up to 500 miles per hour through a 20-foot-diameter test section at the standard operating altitude of 30,000 feet. The airflow was created by a large wooden fan near the tunnel\u2019s southeast corner.       This photograph shows the installation of the 18,000-horsepower drive motor inside the adjoining Exhauster Building in July 1943. The General Electric motor, whose support frame is seen in this photograph, connected to a drive shaft that extended from the building, through the tunnel shell, and into a 12-bladed, 31-foot-diameter spruce wood fan. Flexible couplings on the shaft allowed for the movement of the shell. The corner of the Exhauster Building was built around the motor after its installation.    The General Electric induction motor could produce 10 to 410 revolutions per minute and create wind speeds up to 500 miles per hour, or Mach 0.63, at 30,000 feet. The AWT became operational in January 1944 and tested piston, turbojet and ramjet engines for nearly 20 years.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1943-07-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-01955/GRC-1943-C-01955~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-01955/GRC-1943-C-01955~thumb.jpg"}

Improved fuels and lubrication was an area of particular emphasis at the laboratory during World War II. The military sought to use existing types of piston engines in order to get large numbers of aircraft into the air as quickly as possible. To accomplish its goals, however, the military needed to increase the performance of these engines without having to wait for new models or extensive redesigns. The Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory was called on to lead this effort.        The use of superchargers successfully enhanced engine performance, but the resulting heat increased engine knock [fuel detonation] and structural wear. These effects could be offset with improved cooling, lubrication, and fuel mixtures. The NACA researchers in the Fuels and Lubrication Division concentrated on new synthetic fuels, higher octane fuels, and fuel-injection systems. The laboratory studied 16 different types of fuel blends during the war, including extensive investigations of triptane and xylidine.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1943-08-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-02124/GRC-1943-C-02124~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-02124/GRC-1943-C-02124~thumb.jpg"}

The V\u20131710 was the only liquid-cooled engine used during World War II, and the military counted on it to power several types of fighter aircraft.       The NACA instituted an Apprentice Program during the war to educate future mechanics, technicians, and electricians. The program was suspended for a number of years due to the increasing rates of military service by its participants. The laboratory continued its in-house education during the war, however, by offering a number of classes to its employees and lectures for the research staff. The classes and lectures were usually taught by fellow members of the staff, but occasionally external experts were brought in.    The students in the Allison class in the Engine Research Building were taught how to completely disassemble and reassemble the engine components and systems.

The military was relying on the liquid-cooled V\u20131710 to power several types of World War II fighter aircraft and wanted to improve the engine's speed and altitude performance. Superchargers forced additional airflow into the combustion chamber, which increased the engine\u2019s performance resulting in greater altitudes and speeds. They also generated excess heat that affected the engine cylinders, oil, and fuel.       In 1943 the military tasked the new Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory to integrate the supercharger, improve the cooling system, and remedy associated engine knock. Three Allison engines were provided to the laboratory\u2019s research divisions. One group was tasked with improving the supercharger performance, another analyzed the effect of the increased heat on knock in the fuel, one was responsible for improving the cooling system, and another would install the new components on the engine with minimal drag penalties.    The modified engines were installed on this 2000-horsepower dynamotor stand in a test cell within the Engine Research Building. The researchers could run the engine at different temperatures, fuel-air ratios, and speeds. When the modifications were complete, the improved V\u20131710 was flight tested on a P\u201363A Kingcobra loaned to the NACA for this project.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1943-03-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-01345/GRC-1943-C-01345~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1943-C-01345/GRC-1943-C-01345~thumb.jpg"}
