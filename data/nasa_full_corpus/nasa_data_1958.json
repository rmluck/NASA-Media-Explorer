Doolittle also worked with the aviation industry on the development of aircraft fuels and instrumentation. After the war he served as vice president of Shell Oil and as a key government advisor. In this capacity he also served on the NACA\u2019s Executive Committee for a number of years and served as its Chairman in 1957 and 1958.    Tesar was a supervisor at the Sheet Metal Shop in the Fabrication Building. He joined the laboratory in 1948 and enrolled in their Apprentice Program. He graduated from the school three years later as an aviation metalsmith. The Fabrication Branch created a wide variety of hardware for the laboratory\u2019s research projects.

The Division conducted a series of impact studies with full scale and model capsules of the original capsule shape A. Joseph Shortal wrote (Vol. 3, p. 16):  The basic design of the capsule was made by M.A. Faget and his coworkers at PARD during the winter of 1957-1958. It was natural, then, that extensive use was made of the facilities at Wallops during the development of the spacecraft. The tests at Wallops consisted of 26 full-size capsules, either launched from the ground by rocket power or dropped from airplanes at high altitude and 28 scaled models, either rocket boosted or released from balloons. Emphasis in the Wallops program was on dynamic stability and aerodynamic heating of the capsule, and effectiveness of the pilot-escape and parachute-recovery systems. The biggest part of the Wallops program was the series of full-size capsules, rocket launched with the Little Joe booster, developed especially for Mercury.  -- Published in Joseph A.

The facility was the largest high-energy test facility in the country that was capable of handling liquid hydrogen and other liquid chemical fuels. The facility\u2019s use of subscale engines up to 20,000 pounds of thrust permitted a cost-effective method of testing engines under various conditions.      The Rocket Engine Test Facility was critical to the development of the technology that led to the use of hydrogen as a rocket fuel and the development of lightweight, regeneratively-cooled, hydrogen-fueled rocket engines. Regeneratively-cooled engines use the cryogenic liquid hydrogen as both the propellant and the coolant to prevent the engine from burning up. The fuel was fed through rows of narrow tubes that surrounded the combustion chamber and nozzle before being ignited inside the combustion chamber. The tubes are visible in the liner sitting on the desk.    At the time, Pratt and Whitney was designing a 20,000-pound thrust liquid-hydrogen rocket engine, the RL-10. Two RL-10s would be used to power the Centaur second-stage rocket in the 1960s.

Nine months later the laboratory became part of the new National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the NACA logo was permanently removed from the hangar.    Algranti served as a Navy fighter pilot from 1946 to 1947 and earned a Physics degree from the University of North Carolina. He joined the NACA Lewis staff in 1951 witnessed the technological transformation from high speed flight to space. At Lewis Algranti piloted icing research flights, operated the liquid-hydrogen pump system for Project Bee, and served as the primary test subject for the Multi-Axis Space Test Inertia Facility (MASTIF). The MASTIF was a device used to train the Mercury astronauts how to control a spinning capsule.     In 1960, Algranti and fellow Lewis pilots Warren North and Harold Ream transferred to NASA\u2019s Space Task Group at Langley to actively participate in the space program. Two years later, Algranti became the Chief of Aircraft Operations and Chief Test Pilot at NASA\u2019s new Manned Space Center in Houston.

The F-84 was a single-seat fighter-bomber powered by an Allison J35 turbojet. It was the Air Force\u2019s first post-World War II tactical aircraft and was used extensively in the Korean War. The laboratory had acquired the aircraft in 1954 and modified it in order to demonstrate the reverse thruster. The tail end of the aircraft was then removed for a series of large nozzle investigations.     Lewis researchers launched an extensive program in the mid-1950s to develop methods of reducing engine noise as the airline industry was preparing to introduce the first turbojet-powered passenger aircraft. The early NACA investigations determined that the primary source of noise was the mixing of the engine\u2019s hot exhaust with the cool surrounding air. Lewis researchers studied many different nozzles designed to facilitate this mixing. Nozzles with elongated exit sections, as seen in this photograph, produced lower noise levels. These long slot nozzles were also considered for Short Take-off and Landing aircraft because their long flat surfaces provided lift.     In 1958 Lewis tested several full-scale slot nozzles on the F-84. The researchers, led by Willard Cole, sought to determine the noise-generation characteristics for nozzles having large a width-to-height ratio. The nozzle in this photograph has a 100 to 1 width-to-height ratio. Cole determined that the experimental nozzles produced the same levels of sound as the standard nozzle, but the changes in the directional noise were substantial.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1958-05-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1958-C-47954/GRC-1958-C-47954~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1958-C-47954/GRC-1958-C-47954~thumb.jpg"}

Lewis underwent a major reorganization and began concentrating its efforts almost exclusively on the space program.    NACA Lewis researchers had been advocating further space research for years. As early as 1955, Lewis management urged the NACA expand its rocket engine research as a logical extension of its aircraft engine work. Lewis management claimed that space exploration was imperative for the nation\u2019s survival during the Cold War. They called for an annual 25-percent increase in the NACA\u2019s staff, a new space laboratory, a launching center, communications center, and other facilities. They were basically outlining what would be needed for the new space agency.     During NASA\u2019s first two years of existence, Lewis refocused its efforts almost completely on the space program. Less than 10 percent of the annual budget was dedicated to aeronautics. In the aftermath that followed President Kennedy\u2019s April 1961 \u201cUrgent Needs\u201d address to Congress, NASA was given a seemingly unlimited budget.

In 1957 and 1958, Dryden was asked by what was then the Civil Aeronautics Administration (later absorbed into the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 1958) to help establish new approach procedure guidelines on cloud-ceiling and visibility minimums for Boeing's first jet airliner, the B-707. Dryden used a KC-135 (the military variant of the 707), seen here on the runway at Edwards Air Force Base, to aid the CAA in these tests.  In 1979 and 1980, Dryden was again involved with general aviation research with the KC-135. This time, a special wingtip \"winglet\", developed by Richard Whitcomb of Langley Research Center, was tested on the jet aircraft. Winglets are small, nearly vertical fins installed on an airplane's wing tips to help produce a forward thrust in the vortices that typically swirl off the end of the wing, thereby reducing drag. This winglet idea was tested at the Dryden Flight Research Center on a KC-135A tanker loaned to NASA by the Air Force. The research showed that the winglets could increase an aircraft's range by as much as 7 percent at cruise speeds. The first application of NASA's winglet technology in industry was in general aviation business jets, but winglets are now being incorporated into most new commercial and military transport jets, including the Gulfstream III and IV business jets, the Boeing 747-400 and MD-11 airliners, and the C-17 military transport.  In the 1980's, a KC-135 was used in support of the Space Shuttle program. Since the Shuttle was to be launched from Florida, researchers wanted to test the effect of rain on the sensitive thermal tiles. Tiles were mounted on special fixtures on an F-104 aircraft and a P-3 Orion. The F-104 was flown in actual rain conditions, and also behind the KC-135 spray tanker as it rel", "keywords": ["KC-135", "KC-135A", "Stratotanker", "Boeing Military Airplane Company", "inflight aircraft refueler", "general aviation", "Shuttle Tile tests", "Civil Aeronautics Administration", "B-707", "Richard Whitcomb", "Langley Research Center"], "center": "AFRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1958-06-05T00:00:00Z", "location": "AFRC", "photographer": "NASA", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/E-4123/E-4123~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/E-4123/E-4123~thumb.jpg"}
