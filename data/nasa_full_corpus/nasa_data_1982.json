Materials processing experiments were also conducted, including crystal growth from a variety of substances such as enzymes, mercury iodide, and a virus.

Replaced by the Space Station concept, the space platform idea was never completed. However, early in the space platform development, astronauts trained at the Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC) Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS), as pictured here, working on solar array equipment.
