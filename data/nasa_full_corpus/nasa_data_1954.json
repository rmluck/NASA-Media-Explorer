Butchart served as Chief (later, Director) of Flight Operations at NASA's Flight Research Center (renamed on March 26, 1976, the Hugh L. Dryden Flight Research Center). Initially, his responsibilities in this position included the Research Pilots Branch, a Maintenance and Manufacturing Branch, and an Operations Engineering Branch, the last of which not only included propulsion and electrical/electronic sections but project engineers for the X-15 and lifting bodies. During his tenure, however, the responsibilities of his directorate came to include not only Flight Test Engineering Support but Flight Systems and Loads laboratories. Before becoming Chief of Flight Operations, Butchart had served since June of 1966 as head of the Research Pilots Branch (Chief Pilot) and then as acting chief of Flight Operations. He had joined the Center (then known as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics' High-Speed Flight Research Station) as a research pilot on May 10, 1951.  During his career as a research pilot, he flew a great variety of research and air-launch aircraft including the D-558-I, D-558-II, B-29 (plus its Navy version, the P2B), X-4, X-5, KC-135, CV-880, CV-990, B-47, B-52, B-747, F-100A, F-101, F-102, F-104, PA-30 Twin Comanche, JetStar, F-111, R4D, B-720, and B-47. Although previously a single-engine pilot, he became the Center's principal multi-engine pilot during a period of air-launches in which the pilot of the air-launch aircraft (B-29 or P2B) basically directed the operations. It was he who called for the chase planes before each drop, directed the positioning of fire rescue vehicles, and released the experimental aircraft after ensuring that all was ready for the drop.  As pilot of the B-29 and P2B, Butchart launched the X-1A once, the X-1B 13 times, the X-1E 22 times, and the D-558-II 102 times. In addition, he towed the M2-F1 lightweight lifting body 14 times behind an R4", "keywords": ["Stanley P.

NACA researchers soon modified the aircraft for the first demonstration of a reverse thruster. Republic built over 4000 Thunderjets between 1947 and 1953 for the military as a successor to the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. TheF-84s became successful multi-use aircraft during the Korean War.      The use of traditional wheel brakes on high speed aircraft was problematic because the required braking system would weigh too much. The reverse thruster was developed as a method for stopping these aircraft without increasing the overall weight. Panels in the tail section near the jet engine\u2019s nozzle opened up during a landing. These extended flaps not only caused resistance to the airstream but also reversed the engine\u2019s thrust.     In June 1964 Irving Pinkel, head of the Lewis Physics Division, oversaw a demonstration of this technology on an F-84 at the NACA laboratory. The side fuselage panels around the engine nozzle, seen closed in this photograph, opened up like wings and deflected the engine\u2019s thrust towards the front of the aircraft, thus producing reverse thrust. The F-84 activated the reverse thruster and the aircraft moved backwards across the runway.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1954-06-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1954-C-36132/GRC-1954-C-36132~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1954-C-36132/GRC-1954-C-36132~thumb.jpg"}

The laboratory had undertaken a multi-year investigation into the causes and prevention of fires on low altitude aircraft crashes. The program was expanded in the mid-1950s to include the study of impact on passengers, types of seat restraints, and seat design.      The crash impact portion of the program began by purposely wrecking surplus Fairchild C-82 Packet and Piper Cub aircraft into barricades at the end of a test runway at the Ravenna Arsenal, located approximately 40 miles south of the Lewis lab in Cleveland. Instrumented dummies and cameras were installed in the pilot and passenger areas. After determining the different loads and their effects on the passengers, the NACA researchers began designing new types of seats and restraints.     The result was an elastic seat that flexed upon impact, absorbing 75 percent of the loads before it slowly recoiled. This photograph shows the seats mounted on a pendulum with a large spring behind the platform to provide the jolt that mimicked the forces of a crash. The seat was constructed without any potentially damaging metal parts and included rubber-like material, an inflated back and arms, and a seat cushion. After the pendulum tests, the researchers compared the flexible seats to the rigid seats during a crash of a transport aircraft. They found the passengers in the rigid seats received 66 percent higher g-forces than the NACA-designed seats.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1954-05-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1954-C-35858/GRC-1954-C-35858~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1954-C-35858/GRC-1954-C-35858~thumb.jpg"}
