A Piper PA-30 Twin Commanche, known as NASA 808, was used at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center as a rugged workhorse in a variety of research projects associated with both general aviation and military projects.  In the early 1970s, the PA-30, serial number 301498, was used to test a flight technique used to fly Remotely Piloted Research Vehicles (RPRV's). The technique was first tested with the cockpit windows of the light aircraft blacked out while the pilot flew the aircraft utilizing a television monitor which gave him a \"pilot's eye\" view ahead of the aircraft. Later pilots flew the aircraft from a ground cockpit, a procedure used with all RPRV's. TV and two-way telemetry allow the pilot to be in constant control of the aircraft. The apparatus mounted over the cockpit is a special fish eye lens camera, used to obtain images that are transmitted to the ground based cockpit. This project paved the way for sophisticated, highly successful research programs involving high risk spin, stall, and flight control conditions, such as the HiMAT and the subscale F-15 remotely piloted vehicles.  Over the years, NASA 808 has also been used for spin and stall research related to general aviation aircraft and also research to alleviate wake vortices behind large jetliners.", "keywords": ["Piper Twin Comanche", "PA-30", "NASA 808", "general aviation flight control research", "serial number 30-1498", "Remotely Piloted Research Vehicles", "RPRV", "wake vortices", "B-727"], "center": "AFRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1971-10-08T00:00:00Z", "location": "AFRC", "photographer": "NASA", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ECN-2845/ECN-2845~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ECN-2845/ECN-2845~thumb.jpg"}

The F-106B was modified with two General Electric J85-13 engines under its wings to study these components. The original test plan was expanded to include the study of boattail drag, noise reduction, and inlets.   From February to July 1971 the modified F-106B was used to study different ejector nozzles.  Researchers conducted both acoustic and aerodynamic tests on the ground and in flight. Several models were created to test different suppression methods. NASA Lewis\u2019 conical nozzle was used as the baseline configuration.    Flightline and sideline microphones were set up on the ground. The F-106B would idle its own engine and buzz the recording station from an altitude of 300 feet at Mach 0.4 with the test engines firing.  Researchers found that the suppression of the perceived noise level was usually lower during flight than the researchers had statistically predicted. The 64 and 32-spoke nozzles performed well in actual flight, but the others nozzles tended to negatively affect the engine\u2019s performance. Different speeds or angles- -of-attack sometimes changed the noise levels.

The AAP was to include long duration Earth orbital missions during which astronauts would carry out scientific, technological, and engineering experiments in space by utilizing modified Saturn launch vehicles and the Apollo spacecraft. Established in 1970, the Skylab Program was the forerurner of the AAP. The goals of the Skylab were to enrich our scientific knowledge of the Earth, the Sun, the stars, and cosmic space; to study the effects of weightlessness on living organisms, including man; to study the effects of the processing and manufacturing of materials utilizing the absence of gravity; and to conduct Earth resource observations. The Skylab also conducted 19 selected experiments submitted by high school students. Skylab's 3 different 3-man crews spent up to 84 days in Earth orbit. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) had responsibility for developing and integrating most of the major components of the Skylab: the Orbital Workshop (OWS), Airlock Module (AM), Multiple Docking Adapter (MDA), Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM), Payload Shroud (PS), and most of the experiments.

{"nasa_id": "S71-58222", "title": "Apollo 15 Lunar eclipse views", "description": "S71-58222 (31 July-2 Aug. 1971) --- During the lunar eclipse that occurred during the Apollo 15 lunar landing mission, astronaut Alfred M. Worden, command module pilot, used a 35mm Nikon camera to obtain a series of 15 photographs while the moon was entering and exiting Earth's umbra. Although it might seem that there should be no light on the moon when it is in Earth's shadow, sunlight is scattered into this region by Earth's atmosphere. This task was an attempt to measure by photographic photometry the amount of scattered light reaching the moon. The four views from upper left to lower right were selected to show the moon as it entered Earth's umbra. The first is a four-second exposure which was taken at the moment when the moon had just entered umbra; the second is a 15-second exposure taken two minutes after entry; the third, a 30-second exposure three minutes after entry; and the fourth is a 60-second exposure four minutes after entry. In all cases the light reaching the moon was so bright on the very high speed film (Eastman Kodak type 2485 emulsion) that the halation obscures the lunar image, which should be about one-third as big as the circle of light. The background star field is clearly evident, and this is very important for these studies. The spacecraft was in full sunlight when these photographs were taken, and it was pointed almost directly away from the sun so that the windows and a close-in portion of the camera's line-of-sight were in shadow. The environment around the vehicle at this time appears to be very \"clean\" with no light scattering particles noticeable.", "keywords": ["APOLLO 15 FLIGHT", "APOLLO PROJECT", "EARTH (PLANET)", "ECLIPSES", "LUNAR ECLIPSES", "OBSERVATION", "PHOTOGRAPHY"], "center": "JSC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1971-08-01T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S71-58222/S71-58222~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S71-58222/S71-58222~thumb.jpg"}
