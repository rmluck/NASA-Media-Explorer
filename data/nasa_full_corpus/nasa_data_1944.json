The AWT was a large facility that simulated actual flight conditions at high altitudes. The two primary aspects of altitude simulation are the reduction of the air pressure and the decrease of temperature. The Icing Research Tunnel was a smaller facility in which water droplets were added to the refrigerated air stream to simulate weather conditions that produced ice buildup on aircraft.  The military pressured the NACA to complete the tunnels quickly so they could be of use during World War II. The NACA engineers struggled with the design of this refrigeration system, so Willis Carrier, whose Carrier Corporation had pioneered modern refrigeration, took on the project. The Carrier engineers devised the largest cooling system of its kind in the world. The system could lower the tunnels\u2019 air temperature to \u201347\u2070 F.    The cooling system was powered by 14 Carrier and York compressors, seen in this photograph, which were housed in the Refrigeration Building between the two wind tunnels. The compressors converted the Freon 12 refrigerant into a liquid. The refrigerant was then pumped into zig-zag banks of cooling coils inside the tunnels\u2019 return leg. The Freon absorbed heat from the airflow as it passed through the coils. The heat was transferred to the cooling water and sent to the cooling tower where it was dissipated into the atmosphere.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1944-09-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-06715/GRC-1944-C-06715~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-06715/GRC-1944-C-06715~thumb.jpg"}

The B-29 leapfrogged previous bombers in size, speed, and altitude capabilities. The B\u201329 was intended to soar above anti-aircraft fire and make pinpoint bomb drops onto strategic targets. Four Wright Aeronautical R-3350 engines powered the massive aircraft. The engines, however, frequently strained and overheated due to payload overloading. This resulted in a growing number of engine fires that often resulted in crashes.       The military asked the NACA to tackle the overheating issue. Full-scale engine tests on a R\u20133350 engine in the Prop House demonstrated that a NACA-designed impeller increased the fuel injection system\u2019s flow rate. Single-cylinder studies resolved a valve failure problem by a slight extension of the cylinder head, and researchers in the Engine Research Building combated uneven heating with a new fuel injection system. Investigations during the summer of 1944 in the Altitude Wind Tunnel, which could simulate flight conditions at high altitudes, led to reduction of drag and improved air flow by reshaping the cowling inlet and outlet.

The AWT employed massive cooling and exhaust systems to simulate conditions found at high altitudes. The facility was originally designed to test large piston engines in a simulated flight environment. The introduction of the turbojet during the tunnel\u2019s construction, however, changed the facility\u2019s focus before it became operational. Its first test program was a study of the Bell YP\u201359A Airacomet and its General Electric I\u201316 turbojets.       The Airacomet was the United States\u2019 first attempt to build a jet aircraft.  1600-horsepower centrifugal engines based on an early design by British engineer Frank Whittle were incorporated into an existing Bell airframe. In October 1942 the Airacomet was secretly test flown in the California desert. The aircraft\u2019s performance was limited, however, and the NACA was asked to study the engines in the AWT.    The wind tunnel\u2019s 20-foot-diameter test section was large enough to accommodate entire aircraft with its wing tips and tail removed. The I-16 engines were studied exhaustively in early 1944. They first analyzed the engines in their original configuration and then implemented a boundary layer removal duct, a new nacelle inlet, and new cooling seals. Tests of the modified version showed that the improved distribution of airflow increased the I\u201316\u2019s performance by 25 percent. The Airacomet never overcame some of its inherent design issues, but the AWT went on to study nearly every emerging US turbojet model during the next decade.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1944-03-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-04312/GRC-1944-C-04312~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-04312/GRC-1944-C-04312~thumb.jpg"}

The V\u20131710-powered P\u201363A was a single-seat fighter that could reach speeds of 410 miles per hour and an altitude of 43,000 feet. The fighter, first produced in 1942, was an improvement on Bell\u2019s P\u201339, but persistent performance problems at high altitudes prevented its acceptance by the Air Corps. Instead many of the P\u201363s were transferred to the Soviet Union.       Almost every test facility at the NACA\u2019s engine lab was used to study the Allison V\u20131710 engine and its supercharger during World War II. Researchers were able to improve the efficiency, capacity and pressure ratio of the supercharger. They found that improved cooling significantly reduced engine knock in the fuel.    Once the researchers were satisfied with their improvements, the new supercharger and cooling components were installed on the P\u201363A. The Flight Research Division first established the aircraft\u2019s normal flight performance parameters such as speed at various altitudes, rate of climb, and peak altitude.

The Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory (AERL) undertook an extensive recruiting effort to remedy the situation. Current employees were asked to bring in friends and family members, including women. The number of women employed at the AERL nearly doubled to 412 between 1943 and 1944.    In May 1944 Director Raymond Sharp initiated a program to train women as machine operators, electricians, instrumentation engineers, and other technical positions. The move coincided with the lab\u2019s implementation of a third shift to meet the military\u2019s demands for improved aircraft performance. There was also a modest, but important, number of female engineers and chemists, as well as large group employed in more traditional positions such as data analysts, editors, and clerks.     The integration of women in the research process was critical. Researchers developed a test and submitted plans to the Drafting Section to be converted into blueprints. In some instances the Instrumentation Shop was asked to create instruments for the test. During the test, computers gathered and analyzed the data. The researcher then wrote the report which was reviewed by the Editorial Department and printed in the Duplication Unit. All of these tasks were generally performed by female employees.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1944-06-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-05380/GRC-1944-C-05380~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-05380/GRC-1944-C-05380~thumb.jpg"}

Westinghouse started the development of a series of relatively small axial-flow turbojets for the Navy shortly after Pearl Harbor. In 1943 the 19A engine became both the first operational US-designed jet engine and the only U.S. turbojet incorporated into an aircraft during the war in Europe.        In March 1943 Westinghouse agreed to create an improved six-stage 1400-pound thrust version, the 19B. The engine underwent its first test run a year later in March 1944. Almost immediately the navy agreed to Westinghouse\u2019s proposal for the even larger 10-stage, 1600-pound-thrust 19XB prototype. By July 1944 the navy had contracted with the NACA for the testing of both engines in the AWT. The tunnel was the nation\u2019s only facility for studying full-scale engines in simulated altitude conditions.     The wind tunnel investigations, which began on September 9, 1944, revealed the superiority of the previously untested 19XB over the 19B. The 19B engines failed to restart consistently and suffered combustion blowouts above 17,000 feet. The 19XB, however, performed well and restarted routinely at twice that altitude. Two months later on January 26, 1945, two 19Bs powered a McDonnell XFD\u20131 Phantom, the US Navy\u2019s first fighter jet, on its initial flight. Following its exceptional performance in the AWT, the 19XB engines soon replaced the 19Bs in the Phantom.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1944-11-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-07564/GRC-1944-C-07564~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-07564/GRC-1944-C-07564~thumb.jpg"}

The B\u201329 was the Army Air Forces\u2019 deadliest weapon during the latter portion of World War II. The aircraft was significantly larger than previous bombers but could fly faster and higher. The B\u201329 was intended to soar above anti-aircraft fire and make pinpoint drops onto strategic targets. The bomber was forced to carry 20,000 pounds more armament than it was designed for. The extra weight pushed the B\u201329\u2019s four powerful Wright R\u20133350 engines to their operating limits. The over-heating of the engines proved to be a dangerous problem.       The military asked the NACA to tackle the issue. Full-scale engine tests on a R\u20133350 engine in the Prop House demonstrated that a NACA-designed impeller increased the flow rate of the fuel injection system. Altitude Wind Tunnel studies of the engine led to the reshaping of cowling inlet and outlet to improve airflow and reduce drag. Single-cylinder studies on valve failures were resolved by a slight extension of the cylinder head, and the Engine Research Building researchers combated uneven heating with a new fuel injection system.  The modifications were then tried out on an actual B\u201329. The bomber arrived in Cleveland on June 22, 1944. The new injection impeller, ducted head baffles and instrumentation were installed on the bomber\u2019s two left wing engines. Eleven test flights were flown over the next month with military pilots at the helm. Overall the flight tests corroborated the wind tunnel and test stand studies.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1944-07-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-05491/GRC-1944-C-05491~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1944-C-05491/GRC-1944-C-05491~thumb.jpg"}
