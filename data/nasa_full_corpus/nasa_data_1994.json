{"nasa_id": "sts059-s-079", "title": "Three frequency false-color image of Prince Albert, Canada", "description": "STS059-S-079 (18 April 1994) --- This is a false-color, three frequency image of Prince Albert, Canada, centered at 53.91 north latitude and 104.69 west longitude.  It was produced using data from the X-Band, C-Band and L-Band radars that comprise the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR).  SIR-C/X-SAR acquired this image on the 20th orbit of the Space Shuttle Endeavour.  The area is located 40 kilometers north and 30 kilometers east of the town of Prince Albert in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.  The image covers the area east of the Candle Lake, between gravel surface Highways 120 and 106 and west of 106.  The area in the middle of the image covers the entire Nipawin (Narrow Hills) provincial park.  The look angle of the radar is 30 degrees and the size of the image is approximately 20 by 50 kilometers.  The red, green, and blue colors represent L-Band total power, C-Band total power, and XVV respectively.  The changes in the intensity of each color are related to various surface conditions such as frozen or thawed forest, fire, deforestation and areas of regrowth.  Most of the dark blue areas in the image are the ice covered lakes.  The dark area on the top right corner of the image is the White Gull Lake north of the intersection of Highway 120 and 913.  The right middle part of the image shows Lake Ispuchaw and Lower Fishing Lake.  The deforested areas are shown by light blue in the image.  Since most of the logging practice at the Prince Albert area is around the major highways, the deforested areas can be easily detected as small geometrically shaped dark regions along the roads.  At the time these data were taken, a major part of the forest was either frozen or undergoing the spring thaw.  In such conditions, due to low volume of water in the vegetation, a deeper layer of the canopy is imaged by the radar, revealing valuable information about the type of trees, the amount of vegetation biomass and the condition of the surface.  As the frequency increases, the penetration depth in the canopy decreases.  Over forest canopies, the X-Band radar contains information about the top of the canopy.  Whereas, C-Band and L-Band radar returns show contributions from the crown and trunk areas respectively.  The bright areas in the image are dense mixed aspen and old jackpine forests where the return from all three bands is high.  The reddish area corresponds to more sparse old jack pine (12 to 17 meters in height and 60 to 75 years old) where the L-Band signal penetrates deeper in the canopy and dominates C-Band and X-Band returns.  Comparison of the image with the forest cover map of the area indicates that the three band radar can be used to classify various stands.  SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm), and X-Band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  X-SAR was developed by the Dornire and Alenia Spazio Companies for the German Space Agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian Space Agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

The principle objective is to distinguish between the effects of microgravity on specific information-processing skills affecting performance and those of fatigue caused by long work periods. To measure these skills, the investigators use a set of computerized performance tests called the Performance Assessment Workstation, which is based on current theoretical models of human performance. The tests were selected by analyzing tasks related to space missions and their hypothesized sensitivity to microgravity.

The image was acquired using the L-Band radar channel (horizontally transmitted and received and horizontally transmitted and vertically received) polarization's combined.  The data were acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on orbit 50 on October 3, 1994.  The area shown is approximately 37 by 25 kilometers (23 by 16 miles).  The radar data, coupled with pre-flood aerial photography and satellite data and post-flood topographic and field data, are being used to evaluate changes associated with levee breaks in land forms, where deposits formed during the widespread flooding in 1993 along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.  The distinct radar scattering properties of farmland, sand fields and scoured areas will be used to inventory flood plains along the Missouri River and determine the processes by which these areas return to preflood conditions.  The image shows one such levee break near Glasgow, Missouri.  In the upper center of the radar image, below the bend of the river, is a region covered by several meters of sand, shown as dark regions.  West (left) of the dark areas, a gap in the levee tree canopy shows the area where the levee failed.

On the morning of Sept. 19, 1994, two volcanic cones on the opposite sides of the 6-kilometer sea crater had begun to erupt with very little warning. Discovery flew just east of the eruption roughly 24 hours after it started and near the peak of its activity.  New Ireland, the cloud-covered area in the foreground, lies just east of Rabaul harbor. The eruption, which sent a plume up to over 60,000 feet into the atmosphere, caused over 50,000 people to evacuate the area. Because winds were light at the time of the eruption, most of the ash was deposited in a region within 20 kilometers of the eruption zone. This photo shows the large white billowing eruption plume is carried in a westerly direction by the weak prevailing winds. At the base of the eruption column is a layer of yellow-brown ash being distributed by lower level winds. A sharp boundary moving outward from the center of the eruption in the lower cloud is a pulse of laterally-moving ash which results from a volcanic explosion. Geologists theorize that the large white column and the lower gray cloud are likely from the two main vents on each side of the harbor. The bay and harbor of Rabaul are covered with a layer of ash, possibly partly infilled with volcanic material. Matupit Island and the airport runway have disappeared into the bay. More than a meter of ash has fallen upon the city of Rabaul. Up to five vents were reported to have erupted at once, including the two cones Vulcan and Tavurvur, which are opposites of the harbor as well as new vents below the bay. Half of the Vulcan cone has collapsed into the sea. The extra day in space due to bad weather at the landing site afforded the crew the opportunity for both still and video coverage of the event.

The width of the canal zones extends generally 8 kilometers (5 miles) on either side of the shipping channel, except near Madden Lake.  The canal connects the Atlantic Ocean (coastal city of Colon) with the Pacific Ocean near Panama City in a line that takes a northwest to southeast course because of the configuration of the isthmus.  The canal zigzags across the isthmus to take advantage of the geographic features of the area such as the Chagres River.  The controlled water supply for the canal is provided by the three artificial lakes: Gatun near the Atlantic terminus, Miraflores near the Pacific terminus and Madden about halfway across the isthmus.  Gatun is the largest of the three lakes covering an area of 429 square kilometers (165 square miles).  In the midst of this lake is Barro Colorado Island, a world-famous wild game perserve.  Madden Lake was built as a large supplemental reservoir to keep water levels up in the canal during the dry season.

It was taken by the L-Band radar in HH polarization from the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) on the 40th orbit of the Space Shuttle Endeavour.  This view was constructed by overlaying a SIR-C radar image on a U.S. Geological Survey digital elevation map.  The image is centered at about .5 degrees south latitude and 91 degrees west longitude, and covers an area of 75 by 60 kilometers.  The radar incidence angle at the center of the image is about 20 degrees.  The western Galapagos Islands, which lie about 1200 kilometers west of Ecuador in the eastern Pacific, have six active volcanoes similar to the volcanoes found in Hawaii.  Since the time of Charles Darwin's visit to the area in 1835, there have been over 60 recorded eruptions on these volcanoes.  This SIR-C/X-SAR image of Alcedo and Sierra Negra volcanoes shows the rougher lava flows as bright features, while ash deposits and smooth pahoehoe lava flows appear dark.  The Galapagos Islands are one of the SIR-C/X-SAR supersites and data of this area will be taken several times during the flight to allow scientists to conduct topographic change studies and to search for different lava flow types, ash deposits and fault lines.  SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm), and X-Band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  X-SAR was developed by the Dornire and Alenia Spazio Companies for the German Space Agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian Space Agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

The volcano last erupted about 150 years ago and numerous large floods and debris flows have originated on its slopes during the last century.  Today the volcano is heavily mantled with glaciers and snow fields.  More than 100,000 people live on young volcanic mud flows less than 10,000 years old and, are within the range of future, devastating mud slides.  This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on its 20th orbit on October 1, 1994.  The area shown in the image is approximately 59 by 60 kilometers (36.5 by 37 miles).  North is toward the top left of the image, which was composed by assigning red and green colors to the L-Band, horizontally transmitted and vertically, and the L-Band, horizontally transmitted and vertically received.  Blue indicates the C-Band, horizontally transmitted and vertically received.  In addition to highlighting topographic slopes facing the Space Shuttle, SIR-C records rugged areas as brighter and smooth areas as darker.  The scene was illuminated by the Shuttle's radar from the northwest so that northwest-facing slopes are brighter and southeast-facing slopes are dark.  Forested regions are pale green in color, clear cuts and bare ground are bluish or purple; ice is dark green and white.  The round cone at the center of the image is the 14,435 feet (4,399 meters) active volcano, Mount Rainier.  On the lower slopes is a zone of rock ridges and rubble (purple to reddish) above coniferous forests (in yellow/green).  The western boundary of Mount Rainier National Park is seen as a transition from protected, old-growth forest to heavily logged private land, a mosaic of recent clear cuts (bright purple/blue) and partially re-grown timber plantations (pale blue).  The prominent river seen curving away from the mountain at the top of the image (to the northwest) is the White River, and the river leaving the mountain at the bottom right of the image (south) is the Nisqually River, which flows out of the Nisqually glacier on the mountain.  The river leaving to the left of the mountain is the Carbon River, leading west and north toward heavily populated regions near Tacoma.  The dark patch at the top right of the image is Bumping Lake.  Other dark areas seen to the right of ridges throughout the image are radar shadow zones.  Radar images can be used to study the volcanic structure and the surrounding regions with linear rock boundaries and faults.  In addition, the recovery of forested lands from natural disasters and the success of re-forestation programs can also be monitored.  Ultimately this data may be used to study the advance and retreat of glaciers and other forces of global change.

Dr. Chiaki Mukai is one of the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) astronauts chosen by NASA as a payload specialist (PS). She was the second NASDA PS who flew aboard the Space Shuttle, and was the first female astronaut in Asia. When humans go into space, the lack of gravity causes many changes in the body. One change is that fluids normally kept in the lower body by gravity shift upward to the head and chest. This is why astronauts' faces appear chubby or puffy. The change in fluid volume also affects the heart. The reduced fluid volume means that there is less blood to circulate through the body. Crewmembers may experience reduced blood flow to the brain when returning to Earth. This leads to fainting or near-fainting episodes. With the use of the LBNP to simulate the pull of gravity in conjunction with fluids, salt tablets can recondition the cardiovascular system. This treatment, called \"soak,\" is effective up to 24 hours. The LBNP uses a three-layer collapsible cylinder that seals around the crewmember's waist which simulates the effects of gravity and helps pull fluids into the lower body. The data collected will be analyzed to determine physiological changes in the crewmembers and effectiveness of the treatment. The IML-2 was the second in a series of Spacelab flights designed by the international science community to conduct research in a microgravity environment Managed by the Marshall Space Flight Center, the IML-2 was launched on July 8, 1994 aboard the STS-65 Space Shuttle Orbiter Columbia mission.", "keywords": ["STS-65", "Chiaki Mukai", "International Microgravity Laboratory-2", "IML-2", "Lower Body Negative Pressure", "LBNP"], "center": "MSFC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1994-07-01T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/9412206/9412206~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/9412206/9412206~thumb.jpg"}

It was acquired from the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on its 67th orbit, April 13, 1994.  In this color representation, red is C-Band HV-polarization, green is C-Band VV-polarization and blue is the ratio of C-Band VV to C-Band HV.  Blue areas are smooth and yellow areas are rock outcrops with varying amounts of snow and vegetation.  Crowley Lake is in the foreground and Highway 395 crosses in the middle of the image.  Mammoth Mountain is shown in the upper right.  SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).

Recent above normal precipitation (snowfall) of the last two years has helped in alleviating the drought conditions that had prevailed throughout most of California in the mid and late 1980's and early 1990's.", "keywords": ["CALIFORNIA", "MOUNTAINS", "LAKES", "SNOW", "EARTH OBSERVATIONS (FROM SPACE)", "STS-58", "COLUMBIA (ORBITER)", "ONBOARD ACTIVITIES", "NEVADA"], "center": "JSC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1994-10-20T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts058-72-004/sts058-72-004~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts058-72-004/sts058-72-004~thumb.jpg"}

The Okavango is one of the wilder, less spoiled regions of Africa. The area still supports great herds of wild animals such as elephant, zebra and the cape buffalo. Despite conservation efforts from the stable government of Botswana, delta habitats are pressured. The Okavango River (lower left of view) brings water from the high, wet plateaus of Angola into the Kalahari Desert, and enormous inland basin. As a result of a series of small faults (upper center of the view) related to the African Rift System, the river is dammed up in the form of swampy inland delta. Here, water is consumed by evaporation, infiltration, and the swamp forests. Late summer floods take six months to slowly penetrate the 160 kilometer (95 miles) to the other end of the Delta. The visual patterns of the area are strongly linear: straight sand dunes occur in many places and can be seen across the bottom portion of the photograph. Numerous brush-fire scars produce a complex, straight-edged pattern over much of the lower portion of this view. Lake Ngami (upper right of view) was once permanently full as late as the middle 1800's.

SRL-2 is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) *project. The world's land masses and oceans dominate the center field, with the space shuttle Endeavour circling the globe. The SRL-2 letters span the width and breadth of planet Earth, symbolizing worldwide coverage of the two prime experiments of STS-68 - The Shuttle Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) instruments, and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites (MAPS) sensor. The red, blue and black colors of the insignia represent the three operating wavelengths of SIR-C/X-SAR, and the gold band surrounding the globe symbolizes the atmospheric envelope examined by MAPS. The flags of international partners Germany and Italy are shown opposite Endeavour. The relationship of the orbiter to Earth highlights the usefulness of human spaceflights in understanding Earth's environment, and the monitoring its changing surface and atmosphere. In the words of the crew members, \"the soaring orbiter also typifies the excellence of the NASA team in exploring our own world, using the tools which the Space Program developed to explore the other planets in the solar system\". This STS-68 patch was designed by artist Sean Collins.    The NASA insignia design for space shuttle flights is reserved for use by the astronauts and for other official use as the NASA Administrator may authorize. Public availability has been approved only in the forms of illustrations by the various news media.

Ida is the large object to the left, about 56 kilometers (35 miles long).  Ida's natural satellite is the small object to the right.  This portrait was taken by Galileo's charge-coupled device (CCD) camera on August 28, 1993, about 14 minutes before the spacecraft's closest approach to the asteriod, from a range of 10,870 kilometers (6,755 miles).  Ida is a heavily cratered, irregularly shaped asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter-- the 243rd asteroid to be discovered since the first one was found at the beginning of the 19th century.  It is a member of a group of asteroids called the Koronis family.  The small satellite, which is about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) across in this view, has yet to be given a name by astronomers.  It has been provisionally designated '1993 (243) 1' by the International Astronomical Union.  (The numbers denote the year the picture was taken, the asteroid number and the fact that it is the first moon of Ida to be found.)  ALthough the satellite appears to be 'next' to Ida it is actually slightly in the foreground, closer to the spacecraft than Ida.  Combining this image with data from Galileo's near-infrared mapping spectrometer, the science team estimates that the object is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from the center of Ida.  This image is one of a six-frame series taken through different color filters, this one in green.  The spatial resolution in this image is about 100 meters (330 feet) per pixel.  The Galileo spacecraft flew past Ida en route to its final destination, Jupiter, where it will go into orbit in December 1995.

{"nasa_id": "sts059-s-026", "title": "Death Valley, California", "description": "STS059-S-026 (11 April 1994) --- This is an image of Death Valley, California, centered at 36.629 degrees north latitude, 117.069 degrees west longitude.  The image shows Furnace Creek alluvial fan and Furnace Creek Ranch at the far right, and the sand dunes near Stove Pipe Wells at the center.  The dark fork-shaped feature between Furnace Creek fan and the dunes is a smooth flood-plain which encloses Cottonball Basin.  The SIR-C/X-SAR supersite is an area of extensive field investigations and has been visited by both Space Radar Lab astronaut crews.  Elevations in the Valley range from 70 meters below sea level, the lowest in the United States, to more than 3300 meters above sea level.  Scientists are using SIR-C/X-SAR data from Death Valley to help answer a number of different questions about the Earth's geology.  One question concerns how alluvial fans are formed and change through time under the influence of climatic changes and earthquakes.  Alluvial fans are gravel deposits that wash down from the mountains over time.  They are visible in the image as circular, fan-shaped bright areas extending into the darker valley floor from the mountains.  Information about the alluvial fans help scientists study Earth's ancient climate.  Scientists know the fans are bulit up through climatic and tectonic processes and they will use the SIR-C/X-SAR data to understand the nature and rates of weathering processes on the fans, soil formation, and the transport of sand and dust by the wind.  SIR-C/X-SAR's sensitivity to centimeter-scale (or inch-scale) roughness provides detailed maps of surface texture.  Such information can be used to study the occurrence and movement of dust storms and sand dunes.  the goal of these studies is to gain a better understanding of the record of past climatic changes and the effects of those changes on a sensitive environment.  This may lead to a better ability to predict future response of the land to different potential global cimate-change scenarios.  Death Valley is also one of the primary calibration sites for SIR-C/X-SAR.  The bright dots near the center of the image are corner reflectors that have been set-up to calibrate the radar as the Shuttle passes overhead.  Thirty triangular-shaped reflectors (they look like aluminum pyramids) have been deployed by the calibration team from JPL over a 40 kilometer by 40 kilometer area in and around Death Valley.  The calibration team will also deploy transponders (electronic reflectors) and recievers to measure the radar signals from SIR-C/X-SAR on the ground.  Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  The radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm), and X-Band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C was develpoed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  X-SAR was developed by the Dornire and Alenia Spazio Companies for the German Space Agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian Space Agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

{"nasa_id": "sts059-s-074", "title": "Color composite C-band and L-band image of Kilauea volcanoe on Hawaii", "description": "STS059-S-074 (15 April 1994) --- This color composite C-Band and L-Band image of the Kilauea volcano on the big island of Hawaii was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) flying on the Space Shuttle Endeavour.  The city of Hilo can be seen at the top.  The image shows the different types of lava flows around the crater Pu'u O'o.  Ash deposits which erupted in 1790 from the summit of Kilauea volcano show up as dark in this image, and fine details associated with lava flows which erupted in 1919 and 1974 can be seen to the south of the summit in an area called the Ka'u Desert.  In addition, the other historic lava flows created in 1881 and 1984 from Mauna Loa volcano (out of view to the left of this image) can easily be seen despite the fact that the surrounding area is covered by forest.  Such information will be used to map the extent of such flows, which can pose a hazard to the subdivisions of Hilo.  Highway 11 is the linear feature running from Hilo to the Kilauea volcano.  The Kilauea volcano has been almost continuously active for more than the last 11 years.  Field teams that were on the ground specifically to support these radar observations report that there was vigorous surface activity about 400 meters (one-quarter mile) inland from the coast.  A moving lava flow about 200 meters (660 feet) in length was observed at the time of the Shuttle over flight, raising the possibility that subsequent images taken during this mission will show changes in the landscape.  SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm), and X-Band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.

Jupiter was imaged on May 18, 1994, when the giant planet was at a distance of 420 million miles (670 million KM) from Earth. This 'true-color' picture was assembled from separate HST exposures in red, blue, and green light. Jupiter's rotation between exposures creates the blue and red fringe on either side of the disk. HST can resolve details in Jpiter's magnifient cloud belts and zones as small as 200 miles (320 km) across (wide field mode). This detailed view is only surpassed by images from spacecraft that have traveled to Jupiter.   The dark spot on the disk of Jupiter is the shadow of the inner moon Io. This volcanic moon appears as an orange and yellow disk just to the upper right of the shadow. Though Io is approximately the size of Earth's Moon (but 2,000 times farther away), HST can resolve surface details.  When the comet was observed on May 17, its train of 21 icy fragments stretched across 710 thousand miles (1.1 million km) of space, or 3 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. This required six WFPC exposures along the comet train to include all the nuclei. The image was taken in red light.  The apparent angular size of Jupiter relative to the comet, and its angular separation from the comet when the images were taken, have been modified for illustration purposes.  CREDIT: H.A.

This view shows the northern end of the lake, and was taken in the early morning with low sun highlighting the mountain ranges rimming the lake basin.  Pristine forests surround the lake, although heavy logging is evident in other photography of the central and southern portions of the lake.  Another unique aspect of Lake Baikal is the existence of the world's only known freshwater hydrothermal springs.

Two months after its deployment in space, scientists detected a 2-micron spherical aberration in the primary mirror of the HST that affected the telescope's ability to focus faint light sources into a precise point. This imperfection was very slight, one-fiftieth of the width of a human hair. During four spacewalks, the STS-61 crew replaced the solar panel with its flexing problems; the WF/PC1 with the WF/PC2, with built-in corrective optics; and the High-Speed Photometer with the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), to correct the aberration for the remaining instruments.

The insignia shows the ASTRO-2 telescopes in the space shuttle Endeavour's payload bay, orbiting high above Earth's atmosphere. The three sets of rays, diverging from the telescope on the patch atop the Instrument Pointing System (IPS), correspond to the three ASTRO-2 telescopes -- the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT), the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT), and the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment (WUPPE).  The telescopes are co-aligned to simultaneously view the same astronomical object, as shown by the convergence of rays on the NASA symbol. This symbol also represents the excellence of the union of the NASA teams and universality's in the exploration of the universe through astronomy.  The celestial targets of ASTRO-2 include the observation of planets, stars and galaxies shown in the design. The two small atoms represent the search in the ultraviolet spectrum for the signature of primordial helium in intergalactic space left over from the Big Bang. The observations performed on ASTRO-2 will contribute to man's knowledge and understanding of the vast universe, from the planets in out system to the farthest reaches of space.

This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on its 6th orbit and during the first full-capacity test of the instrument.  This image was produced using both L-Band and C-Band data.  The area shown is approximately 20 kilometers by 50 kilometers.  Raco is located at the eastern end of Michigan's upper peninsula, west of Sault Ste. Marie and south of Whitefish Bay on Lake Superior.  The site is located at the boundary between the boreal forests and the northern temperate forests, a transitional zone that is expected to be ecologically sensitive to anticipated global changes resulting from climatic warming.  On any given day, there is a 60 percent chance that this area will be obscured to some extent by cloud cover which makes it difficult to image using optical sensors.  In this color representation (Red=LHH, Green=LHV, Blue=CHH), darker areas in the image are smooth surfaces such as frozen lakes and other non-forested areas.  The colors are related to the types of trees and the brightness is related to the amount of plant material covering the surface, called forest biomass.  Accurate information about land-cover is important to area resource managers and for use in regional- to global-scale scientific models used to understand global change.  SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm), and X-Band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  X-SAR was developed by the Dornire and Alenia Spazio Companies for the German Space Agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian Space Agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

This desert region known as Patagonia appears as light brown colors.  The coastline is especially dramatic because it is shaped by the tortuous channels carved by glaciers which have left fjords.  These fjords have effectively cut across the continental divide, and are bordered by active volcanoes which reach elevations between 2, 000 - 3,000 meters.  The prominent volcanic peak in the center of the frame is Mt. Melimoya.  To the north is a long, snow-covered volcanic ridge called Cerro Yantales.  Cerro Yantales recently reported greatly increased fumarolic activity, including the emission of yellow gases near the summit.  Russian and American scientists will use this photography to look for further evidence of increased activity like snow melt around the peak.

Chicago is a port of entry; a major Great Lakes port located at the junction of the St. Lawrence Seaway with the Mississippi River system; the busiest air center in the United States; and an important rail and highway transportation hub. Chicago is known for large grain mills and elevators, iron and steel works, steel fabrication plants, stockyards, meat-packing establishments, and printing and publishing houses. In the early days of settlement, the narrow watershed between Lake Michigan and the Des Plaines River (draining the Mississippi River through the Illinois River), offered an easy portage that led explorers like Father Marquette and Louis Joliet and others to the Great Central Plains. Fort Dearborn, a military post was established in 1803. By 1860, the railroad connected Chicago to the rest of the country and the city became a great mid-continent shipping and receiving center. In 1871, the city built of wood, was almost entirely destroyed by a great fire. After the fire, Chicago was built as a city of steel and stone. During the World's Colombian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893, the city became a leading architectural center. It was here during the Exposition that the skyscraper came into being. Chicago continues to lead the way in this type of architectural structure as is evidenced with the completion of the Sears Tower in 1974.", "keywords": ["ILLINOIS", "CITIES", "LAKES", "TRANSPORTATION", "EARTH OBSERVATIONS (FROM SPACE)", "STS-60", "DISCOVERY (ORBITER)"], "center": "JSC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1994-02-09T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts060-103-089/sts060-103-089~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts060-103-089/sts060-103-089~thumb.jpg"}

This color composite image is a three frequency overlay.  L-Band total power was assigned red, the C-Band total power is shown in green and the X-Band VV polarization appears blue.  The colors on the image stress the differences between the L-Band, C-Band, X-Band images.  If the three radar antennas were getting an equal response from objects on the ground, this image would appear in black and white.  However, in this image, the blue areas corresponds to area for which the X-Band backscatter is relatively higher than the backscatter at L and C-Bands.  This behavior is characteristic of grasslands, clear cuts and shorter vegetation.  Similarly, the forested areas have a reddish tint (L-Band).  The green areas seen near both the Ammersee and the Pilsensee lakes indicate marshy areas.  The agricultural fields in the upper right hand corner appear mostly in blue and green (X-Band and C-Band).  The white areas are mostly urban areas, while the smooth surfaces of the lakes appear very dark.  SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm), and X-Band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  X-SAR was developed by the Dornire and Alenia Spazio Companies for the German Space Agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian Space Agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

{"nasa_id": "sts068-s-053", "title": "STS-68 radar image: Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines", "description": "STS068-S-053 (7 October 1994) --- These are color composite radar images showing the area around Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The images were acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994 (left image) and October 5, 1994 (right image).  The images are centered at about 15 degrees north latitude and 120.5 degrees east longitude.  Both images were obtained with the same viewing geometry.  The color composites were made by displaying the L-Band (horizontally transmitted and received) in red; the L-Band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received) in green; and the C-Band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received) in blue.  The area shown is approximately 40 by 65 kilometers (25 by 40 miles).  The main volcanic crater on Mount Pinatubo produced by the June 1991 eruptions and the steep slopes on the upper flanks of the volcano are easily seen in these images.  Red on the high slopes shows the distribution of the ash deposited during the 1991 eruption, which appears red because of the low cross-polarized radar returns at C and L Bands.  The dark drainage's radiating away from the summit are smooth mud flows, which even three years after the eruption continue to flood the river valleys after heavy rain.  Comparing the two images shows that significant changes have occurred in the intervening five months along the Pasig-Potero rivers (the dark area in the lower right of the images).  Mud flows, called &quot;lahars&quot;, that occurred during the 1994 monsoon season filled the river valleys, allowing the lahars to spread over the surrounding countryside.  Three weeks before the second image was obtained, devastating lahars more than doubled the area affected in the Pasig-Potero rivers, which is clearly visible as the increase in dark area on the lower right of the images.  Migration of deposition to the east (right) has affected many communities.  Newly affected areas included the community of Bacolor, Pampanga, where thousands of homes were buried in meters of hot mud and rock as 80,000 people fled the lahar-stricken area.  The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption is well known for its near-global effects on the atmosphere and short-term climate due to the large amount of sulfur dioxide that was injected into the upper atmosphere.  Locally, however, the effects will most likely continue to impact surrounding areas for as long as the next 10 to 15 years.  Mud flows, quite certainly, will continue to pose severe hazards to adjacent areas.  Radar observations like those obtained by SIR-C/X-SAR will play a key role in monitoring these changes because of the radar's ability to see daylight or darkness and even in the worst weather conditions.  Radar imaging will be particularly useful during the monsoon season, when the lahars form.  Frequent imaging of these lahar fields will allow scientists to better predict when they are likely to begin flowing again and which communities might be at risk.

The newt egg is a large single cell at the begirning of development. The Japanese newt mates in spring and autumn. In late autumn, female newts enter hibernation with sperm in their body cavity and in spring lay eggs and fertilized them with the stored sperm. The experiment takes advantage of this feature of the newt. Groups of newts were sent to the Kennedy Space Center and kept in hibernation until the mission. The AAEU cassettes carried four newts aboard the Space Shuttle. Two newts in one cassette are treated by hormone injection on the ground to simulate egg laying. The other two newts are treated on orbit by the crew. The former group started maturization of eggs before launch. The effects of gravity on that early process were differentiated by comparison of the two groups. The IML-2 was the second in a series of Spacelab flights designed to conduct research by the international science community in a microgravity environment.

Visitors to the South Rim can view the canyon in both the east-west and north-south reaches.  The South Rim is closer to centers of transportation so that tourists mostly see the canyon from this area, that is from about 7,000 feet.  The canyon floor lies at 2,000 feet in this sector.  The most heavily snow covered area is the highest, reaching more than 9,000 feet (bottom right).  Visitors see this protected area by hiking and mule and helicopter rides.  The ecology of this part of the Colorado has been changed since the building of a lake upstream: river water is now derived from snow melt water from the bottom of the lake.  This water is much colder than the water which used to flow through the canyon.  According to NASA scientists, the view is unusual because the snow also reveals so well the higher country around the canyon, a swath stretching from bottom right to middle left of the view.  This higher swath is an arch of uplifted rocks known as the Kaibab Plateau, raised vertically by tectonic forces in the recent geologic past.  Despite this up parching, the Colorado River managed to maintain its course to the sea by cutting an ever deeper canyon into the Plateau.  The white snow cover hides the fact that the Kaibab Plateau is thickly forested and thus appears dark green in summer, except in areas of clear-cutting.  Since the Plateau reaches altitudes of 6 to 9,000 feet, it is both cooler and moister than the surrounding lower desert floor (top and bottom in this view) - where sparse vegetation and rocky country appear as brown colors.

{"nasa_id": "sts060-88-070", "title": "Strait of Gibraltar as seen from STS-60", "description": "STS060-88-070 (3-11 Feb 1994) --- This view shows sunglint in the Strait of Gibralter.  In this photograph a high pressure atmospheric system over the Iberian Peninsula has set the conditions for seeing a plankton bloom along the Moroccan coast in the Alboran Sea (Western Mediterranean) coastal counter current as well as illumining the influence of winds in the sunglint pattern near the Strait of Gibraltar.  Where the water is ruffled from a wind gust, such as off Cadiz, Spain, the surface is less reflective and thus appears dark.  A combination of the effects of the tide and the surface winds through the Strait of Gibraltar have created a unique sunglint pattern at the entrance of the Mediterranean.  The Atlantic Ocean waters are flowing with the tide through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea and are probably smoothing out some of the smaller waves at the surface.  The incoming tide generates internal waves as can be faintly seen in this photograph.  The incoming relatively cooler, less dense Atlantic water flows over the warm, more saline Mediterranean water.  As the tide moves into the Strait of Gibraltar it encounters the Camarinal Sill, which is like a cliff under the water, south of Camarinal Point, Spain.  Internal waves are generated at this sill and they travel along the density boundary between the Atlantic water and the Mediterranean water masses.  There is little evidence of the internal waves at the surface of the ocean.  We can see them in spacecraft photography because of the sunglint which reflects off the different water layers in differential patterns.  The internal waves also smooth out some of the bands of capillary waves at the surface.

This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994.  It was produced by combining data from the X-Band, C-Band and L-Band radar's.  The area shown is approximately 25 by 28 kilometers (15 1/2 by 17 1/2 miles).  Flevoland, which fills the lower two-thirds of the image, is a very flat area that is made up of reclaimed land that is used for agriculture and forestry.  At the top of the image, across the canal from Flevoland, is an older forest shown in red; the city of Harderwijk is shown in white on the shore of the canal.  At this time of the year, the agricultural fields are bare soil, and they show up in this images in blue.  The changes in the brightness of the blue areas are equal to the changes in roughness.  The dark blue areas are water and the small dots in the canal are boats.  This SIR-C/X-SAR supersite is being used for both calibration and agricultural studies.  Several soil and crop ground-truth studies will be conducted during the Shuttle flight.  In addition, about 10 calibration devices and 10 corner reflectors have been deployed to calibrate and monitor the radar signal.  One of these transponders can be seen as a bright star in the lower right quadrant of the image.  This false-color image was made using L-Band total power in the red channel, C-Band total power in the green channel, and X-Band VV polarization in the blue channel.  SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.

The area shown is 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Innsbruck, Austria.  This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on its 14th orbit.  Oetztal is a SIR-C/X-SAR hydrology supersite.  Approximately one quarter of this image is covered by glaciers, the largest of which, Gepatschferner, is visible as a triangular yellow patch in the center of the scene.  The summits of the main peaks reach elevations between 3,500 and 3,768 meters (11,500 and 12,362 feet) above sea level.  The tongues of the glaciers are descending from elevated plateaus down into narrow valleys which were formed during the last ice age.  This color image was produced in C-Band using multi-polarization information (Red=CHV, Green=CVV, Blue=CVV/CHV).  The blue areas are lakes (Gepatsch Dam at center right; Lake Muta at top right) and glacier ice.  The yellow areas are slopes facing the radar and areas of dry snow.  Purple corresponds to slopes facing away from the radar.  Yellow in the valley bottom corresponds to tree covered areas.  There is 30 to 50 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) of dry, fresh snow on the glaciers, and about 10 centimeters (4 inches) in the valley at the city of Vent, Austria (center).  At these data were taken, the weather was cold, with snow and thick fog.  The entire area would appear white to an optical sensor because it is all covered under a winter snowpack.  Researchers are interested in Oetztal because knowing how glaciers shrink and grow over time is an important indication of climatic change.

The HMS Victory was severely damaged and dismasted in battle.  A careful inspection of the original film will show the 175-foot long HMS Victory in this frame.  According to NASA geologists it is extremely unusual for Portsmouth to be this cloud-free.  It has been a site of some interest for many Space Shuttle missions during the past 10 years.", "keywords": ["ENGLAND", "ISLANDS", "RIVERS", "CITIES", "EARTH OBSERVATIONS (FROM SPACE)", "STS-60", "DISCOVERY (ORBITER)"], "center": "JSC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1994-02-09T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts060-94-007/sts060-94-007~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts060-94-007/sts060-94-007~thumb.jpg"}

In this frame, the U.S.-Mexico border goes from the upper left to the middle right.  It is discernible as a vegetation line between Calexico, California and Mexicali, Mexico.  The darker vegetation north of that line is due to different agricultural practices, heavier uses of fertilizers and pesticides, and lined (tiled) agricultural fields allowing subterraneean runoff of saline irrigation runoff.  South of the line, the more polluted water draining out of the U.S. agricultural areas into the Mexican area has resulted in higher soil salinities and a consequent reduction in agricultural productivity.

On the morning of Sept. 19, 1994, two volcanic cones on the opposite sides of the 6-kilometer sea crater had begun to erupt with very little warning. Discovery flew just east of the eruption roughly 24 hours after it started and near the peak of its activity.  The eruption, which sent a plume up to over 60,000 feet into the atmosphere, caused over 50,000 people to evacuate the area. Because winds were light at the time of the eruption, most of the ash was deposited in a region within 20 kilometers of the eruption zone.  This photo shows the large white billowing eruption plume is carried in a westerly direction by the weak prevailing winds. At the base of the eruption column is a layer of yellow-brown ash being distributed by lower level winds. A sharp boundary moving outward from the center of the eruption in the lower cloud is a pulse of laterally-moving ash which results from a volcanic explosion. Geologists theorize that the large white column and the lower gray cloud are likely from the two main vents on each side of the harbor. The cloud-covered island in the foreground is New Ireland. The bay and harbor of Rabaul are covered with a layer of ash, possibly partly infilled with volcanic material.  Matupit Island and the airport runway have disappeared into the bay. More than a meter of ash has fallen upon the city of Rabaul. Up to five vents were reported to have erupted at once, including the cones Vulcan and Tavurvur, which are opposites of the harbor as well as new vents below the bay. Half of the Vulcan cone has collapsed into the sea. The extra day in space due to bad weather at the landing site afforded the crew the opportunity for both still and video coverage of the event.

The AstroNewt experiment aims to know the effects of gravity on the early developmental process of fertilized eggs using a unique aquatic animal, the Japanese red-bellied newt. The newt egg is a large single cell at the begirning of development. The Japanese newt mates in spring and autumn. In late autumn, female newts enter hibernation with sperm in their body cavity and in spring lay eggs and fertilize them with the stored sperm. The experiment takes advantage of this feature of the newt. Groups of newts were sent to the Kennedy Space Center and kept in hibernation until the mission. The AAEU cassettes carried four newts aboard the Space Shuttle. Two newts in one cassette are treated by hormone injection on the ground to simulate egg laying. The other two newts are treated on orbit by the crew. The former group started maturization of eggs before launch. The effects of gravity on that early process were differentiated by comparison of the two groups. The IML-2 was the second in a series of Spacelab flights designed to conduct research by the international science community in a microgravity environment.

The area shown is approximately 8 kilometers by 40 kilometers (5 by 25 miles).  At the top of the image are the Solimoes and Rio Negro Rivers just before they combine at Manaus to form the Amazon River.  The image is centered at about 3 degrees south latitude, and 61 degrees west longitude.  The false colors are created by displaying three L-Band polarization channels; red areas correspond to high backscatter at HH polarization, while green areas exhibit high backscatter at HV polarization.  Blue areas show low returns at VV polarization; hence the bright blue colors of the smooth river surfaces.  Using this color scheme, green areas in the image are heavily forested, while blue areas are either cleared forest or open water.  The yellow and red areas are flooded forest.  Between Rio Solimoes and Rio Negro a road can be seen running from some cleared areas (visible as blue rectangles north of Rio Solimoes) north towards a tributary of Rio Negro.   SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm), and X-Band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

{"nasa_id": "sts059-s-039", "title": "False-color composite image of Prince Albert, Canada", "description": "STS059-S-039 (11 April 1994) --- This is a false-color composite of Prince Albert, Canada, centered at 53.91 north latitude and 104.69 west longitude.  This image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on its 20th orbit.  The area is located 40 kilometers (25 miles) north and 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of the town of Prince Albert in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.  The image covers the area east of the Candle Lake, between gravel surface Highways 120 and 106 and west of 106.  The area in the middle of the image covers the entire Nipawin (Narrow Hills) provincial park.  The look angle of the radar is 30 degrees and the size of the image is approximately 20 kilometers by 50 kilometers (12 by 30 miles).  The image was produced by using only the L-Band.  The three polarization channels HH, HV and VV are illustrated by red, green and blue respectively.  The changes in the intensity of each color are related to various surface conditions such as variations in forest stands, frozen or thawed condition of the surface, disturbances (fire and deforestation), and areas of re-growth.  Most of the dark areas in the image are the ice-covered lakes in the region.  The dark area on the top right corner of the image is the White Gull Lake north of the intersection of Highway 120 and 913.  The right middle part of the image shows Lake Ispuchaw and Lower Fishing Lake.  The deforested areas are also shown by dark areas in the image.  Since most of the logging practice at the Prince Albert area is around the major highways, the deforested areas can be easily detected as small geometrically shaped dark regions along the roads.  At the time of the SIR-C/X-SAR overpass, a major part of the forest is either frozen or undergoing the spring thaw.  The L-Band HH shows a high return in the jack pine forest.  The reddish areas in the image are old jack pine forest, 12-17 meters (40-55 feet) in height and 60-75 years old.  The orange-greenish areas are young jack pine trees, 3-5 meters (10-16 feet) in height and 11-16 years old.  The green areas are due to the relative high intensity of the HV channel which is strongly correlated with the amount of biomass.  L-Band HV channel shows the biomass variations over the entire region.  Most of the green areas, when compared to the forest cover maps are identified as black spruce trees.  The dark blue and dark purple colors show recently harvested or re-growth areas respectively.  SIR-C/X-SAR is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm), and X-Band (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to better understand the global environment and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, complemented by aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer insights into those environmental changes which are caused by nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  X-SAR was developed by the Dornire and Alenia Spazio Companies for the German Space Agency, Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian Space Agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

{"nasa_id": "STS062-85-021", "title": "Mississippi River Delta, Louisiana as seen from STS-62", "description": "STS062-85-021 (4-18 March 1994) --- The Mississippi River is the largest river system in North America. Its delta is a typical example of the bird's foot class of river deltas. It drains nearly 3 1/2 million square kilometers of real estate and is estimated to carry 2.4 billion kilograms (more than 500 million tons) of sand, silt, and clay to the Gulf of Mexico annually. Most of this sediment is deposited as a delta at the mouth of the river where the velocity of the river water is slowed and its ability to transport sediment is accordingly diminished. Continued deposition at such a site progrades the delta or extends it seaward into the Gulf as much as 150 meters each year until such time as a flooding episode finds a shorter more efficient channel to deliver sediment-laden river waters to the Gulf.  At that time the old delta is abandoned and the river begins to build a new delta. In time, compaction of the sediment in the old delta causes it to subside forming first marshes, then bays. This and the modifying effects of coastal waves eventually allow the sea to reclaim much of the temporary land area of the delta. This sequence has repeated itself over and over again at the Mississippi Delta.  In this photograph, the present day active Balize delta is shown. According to NASA scientists it is the youngest of the recent delta lobes having begun its seaward pro-gradation only some 600 - 800 years ago. The main channel of the river is 2 kilometers wide and 30 - 40 meters deep. Natural levees here are almost 1 kilometer wide and 3 to 4 meters above sea level. Along the active distributaries of the lower delta, natural levees are less than 100 meters wide and generally less than 0.5 meters above sea level. The bird's foot appearance of deltas such as this is characteristic of low coastal energy conditions - that is, low levels of tidal fluctuation and generally low wave energy. The interdistributary bays are extremely shallow, usually less than a few meters, and contain brackish to normal marine waters except during times of flooding, when fresh water fills the bays. Sedimentation within the bays is very slow, occurring only during flood periods. Along the west side of the river, a highway has been built southeastward to Venice.", "keywords": ["DELTAS", "LOUISIANA", "RIVERS", "EARTH OBSERVATIONS (FROM SPACE)", "STS-62", "COLUMBIA (ORBITER)"], "center": "JSC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1994-03-05T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/STS062-85-021/STS062-85-021~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/STS062-85-021/STS062-85-021~thumb.jpg"}

{"nasa_id": "0202795", "title": "Earth Science", "description": "This image depicts a full view of the Earth, taken by the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES-8). The red and green charnels represent visible data, while the blue channel represents inverted 11 micron infrared data. The north and south poles were not actually observed by GOES-8. To produce this image, poles were taken from a GOES-7 image. Owned and operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for intensive data analysis. They circle the Earth in a geosynchronous orbit, which means they orbit the equatorial plane of the Earth at a speed matching the Earth's rotation. This allows them to hover continuously over one position on the surface. The geosynchronous plane is about 35,800 km (22,300 miles) above the Earth, high enough to allow the satellites a full-disc view of the Earth. Because they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the atmospheric triggers for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods, hail storms, and hurricanes. When these conditions develop, the GOES satellites are able to monitor storm development and track their movements. NASA manages the design and launch of the spacecraft.

The map was created by combining interferometric radar data - that is data acquired on different passes of the Space Shuttle Endeavour which are then overlaid to obtain elevation information - acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) during its first flight in April 1994 and its second flight in October 1994.  The area shown is approximately 40 by 80 kilometers (25 by 50 miles).  North is toward the upper left of the image.  The colors indicate the displacement of the surface in that direction that the radar instrument was pointed (toward the right of the image) in the six months between images.  The analysis of ground movement is preliminary, but appears consistent with the motions detected by the Global Positioning System ground receivers that have been used over the past five years.  The south flank of the Kilauea volcano is among the most rapidly deforming terrain's on Earth.  Several regions show motion over the six-month time period.  Most obvious is at the base of Hilina Pali, where 10 centimeters (4 inches) or more of crustal deformation can be seen in a concentrated area near the coastline.  On a more localized scale, the currently active Pu'u O'o summit also shows about 10 centimeters (4 inches) of change near the vent area.  Finally, there are indications of additional movement along the upper southwest rift zone, just below the Kilauea caldera in the image.  Deformation of the south flank is believed to be the result of movements along faults deep beneath the surface of the volcano, as well as injections of magma, or molten rock, into the volcano's &quot;plumbing&quot; system.  Detection of ground motions from space has proven to be a unique capability of imaging radar technology.  Scientists hope to use deformation data acquired by SIR-C/X-SAR and future imaging radar missions to help in better understanding the processes responsible for volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.  Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.

This computer image shows a summary of \"quick look\" data obtained by the MAPS instrument during its first days of operations as part of the Space Shuttle Endeavour's SRL-1 payload.  This data will be processed using more sophisticated techniques following the flight.  The color red indicates areas with the highest levels of carbon monoxide.  These Northern Hemisphere springtime carbon monoxide values are generally significantly higher than the values found in the Southern Hemisphere.  This is in direct contrast to the data obtained by the MAPS experiment during November 1981 and October 1984, i.e. during Northern Hemisphere fall.  The astronauts aboard Endeavour have seen fires in most of the areas showing higher carbon monoxide values (China, Eastern Australia, and equatorial Africa).  The relationship between the observed fires and the higher carbon monoxide values will be investigated following SRL-1 by combining the MAPS data with meteorological data, surface imagery, and Space Shuttle hand-held photographs.  By the end of SRL-1, MAPS will have acquired data over most of the globe between 57 degrees north and 57 degrees south latitudes.  The entire data set will be carefully analyzed using sophisticated post-flight data processing techniques.  The data will then be applied in a variety of scientific studies concerning chemistry and transport processes in the atmosphere.  The MAPS experiment measures the carbon monoxide in the lower atmosphere.  This gas is produced both as a result of natural processes and as a result of human activities.  The primary human resources of carbon monoxide are automobiles and industry and the burning of plant materials.  The primary natural source is the interaction of sunlight with naturally occurring ozone and water vapor.  The strength of all of these sources changes seasonally.", "keywords": ["POLLUTION MONITORING", "AIR POLLUTION", "SPACEBORNE EXPERIMENTS", "STS-59", "MEASURING SPACE SHUTTLE PAYLOADS", "GRAPHS (CHARTS)", "VISUAL AIDS"], "center": "JSC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1994-04-12T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts059-s-040/sts059-s-040~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts059-s-040/sts059-s-040~thumb.jpg"}

Thagard in a cosmonaut space suit in the Training Simulator Facility at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (Star City), near Moscow, Russia.  In March 1995, astronaut Thagard is scheduled to be launched in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft with two cosmonauts to begin a three-month tour of duty on the Russian Mir Space Station.  Thagard, along with his back-up, astronaut Bonnie J. Dunbar, has been training in Russia since February 1994.  During his stay on Mir, he will conduct a variety of life sciences experiments that will provide U.S. investigators with the first long-duration exposure data since Skylab in the late 1970's.  Thagard's mission will end in July when the Space Shuttle Atlantis, carrying the newly installed docking mechanism, docks with Mir Space Station for the first United States - Russian docking operation since Apollo-Soyuz in 1975.  The Orbiter will remain attached to Mir for five days of joint scientific operations before returning home with Thagard and his Russian crew mates and leaving behind two cosmonauts on Mir.", "keywords": ["STS-71", "ASTRONAUTS", "ASTRONAUT TRAINING", "SPACE SUITS", "MOCK-UP", "INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION", "SOYUZ SPACECRAFT", "RUSSIAN FEDERATION"], "center": "JSC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1994-09-20T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S94-45643/S94-45643~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S94-45643/S94-45643~thumb.jpg"}

The space shuttle is trailed by gold plumes representing the astronaut symbol and is superimposed over Earth, much of which is visible from the flight's high inclination orbit.  Sensitive instruments aboard the ATLAS pallet in the shuttle payload bay and on the free-flying Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmospheric-Shuttle Pallet Satellite (CHRISTA-SPAS) will gaze down on Earth and toward the sun, illustrated by the stylized sunrise and visible spectrum.    The NASA insignia design for space shuttle flights is reserved for use by the astronauts and for other official use as the NASA Administrator may authorize. Public availability has been approved only in the forms of illustrations by the various news media. When and if there is any change in this policy, which is not anticipated, the change will be publicly announced.
