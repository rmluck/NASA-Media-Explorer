By July 1941, the staff had expanded to the point that a new shelter was needed. The NACA took possession of what was thereafter referred to as the \u201cFarm House.\u201d It was the only residential structure at the site. The Farm House served as the NACA\u2019s main office until the Administration Building was opened in December 1942.      The Farm House was built in 1827 and purchased by J.B. Perkins in 1849. Perkins did not reside in the house but hired caretakers to maintain the house and property and raise horses. The disposition of the land in the years leading up to the NACA\u2019s takeover is not clear.   After World War II, NACA management did not want visitors\u2019 first impression to be an old farm house. The building was significantly modified to improve its size, appearance, shape, and added many modern conveniences. In the early 1950s the entire structure was relocated to the lot directly behind the Administration Building. It contained personnel and administrative offices for the lab. The Farm House was eventually demolished in 1973 due to deterioration of the wooden structure.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1941-11-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-2011-C-00345/GRC-2011-C-00345~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-2011-C-00345/GRC-2011-C-00345~thumb.jpg"}

The NACA was established in 1915 to coordinate the nation\u2019s aeronautical research. The committee opened a research laboratory at Langley Field in 1920. By the late 1930s, however, European nations, Germany in particular, were building faster and higher flying aircraft. The NACA decided to expand with a new Ames Aeronautical Laboratory dedicated to high-speed flight and the AERL to handle engine-related research.  The NACA examined a number of Midwest locations for its new engine lab before deciding on Cleveland. At the time, Cleveland possessed the nation\u2019s most advanced airport, several key aircraft manufacturing companies, and was home to the National Air Races. Local officials were also able to broker a deal with the power company to discount its electricity rates if the large wind tunnels were operated overnight. The decision was made in October 1940, and the groundbreaking alongside the airport took place on January 23, 1941.

The hangar was the first structure built and was needed as a shelter for the growing staff, who occupied a nearby Farm House at this point.  In January 1941 the Cleveland-area R.P. Carbone Construction Company was selected to build the hangar. Over the ensuing months, however, the NACA management became frustrated by the slow progress on the project. Although Carbone was contracted to complete the entire hangar by August, it was September before even the structural steel frame, seen in this photograph, was in place. Officials estimated the roof and siding were four months behind schedule. This was a serious concern because the lab\u2019s research, support and administrative staff members would soon begin arriving. By mid-September the transite walls began enclosing the skeleton.
