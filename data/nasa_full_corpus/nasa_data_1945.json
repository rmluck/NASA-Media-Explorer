These men were responsible for flying the various National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) aircraft to test new engine modifications, study ice buildup, and determine fuel performance.        Vensel, a veteran pilot from Langley, was the Chief of Flight Operations and a voice of reason at the laboratory. In April 1947 Vensel was transferred to lead the new Muroc Flight Tests Unit in California until 1966. Lilly was a young pilot with recent Navy experience. Lilly also flew in the 1946 National Air Races. He followed Vensel to Muroc in July 1947 where he became the first NACA pilot to penetrate the sound barrier. On May 3, 1948, Lilly became the first NACA pilot to die in the line of duty. Swann was a young civilian pilot when he joined the NACA. He spent his entire career at the Cleveland laboratory, and led the flight operations group from the early 1960s until 1979.    Two World War II veterans joined the crew after the war. Walker was a 24-year-old P\u201338 reconnaissance pilot. He joined the NACA as a physicist in early 1945 but soon worked his way into the cadre of pilots.

The east side of the tunnel was 31 feet in diameter at the southeast corner and 27 feet in diameter at the northeast. The throat section, which connected the northwest corner to the test section, narrowed sharply from 51 to 20 feet in diameter.       The AWT\u2019s altitude simulation required temperature and pressure fluctuations that made the design of the shell more difficult than other tunnels. The simultaneous decrease in both pressure and temperature inside the facility produced uneven stress loads, particularly on the support rings. The steel used in the primary tunnel structure was one inch thick to ensure that the shell did not collapse as the internal air pressure was dropped to simulate high altitudes. It was a massive amount of steel considering the World War II shortages.    The shell was covered with several inches of fiberglass insulation to retain the refrigerated air and a thinner outer steel layer to protect the insulation against the weather. A unique system of rollers was used between the shell and its support piers. These rollers allowed for movement as the shell expanded or contracted during the altitude simulations.

Its two Allison V\u20131710 engines carried the aircraft to altitudes up to 40,000 feet. The P\u201338 was used extensively during World War II in a variety of roles. In August 1943, Lockheed began producing an improved version, the P\u201338J that included better cockpit heating, engine cooling, and dive flaps.  The military loaned the NACA two P\u201338Js to determine the amount of ice formation on the induction system of the turbosupercharger-equipped engines. In 1944 and 1945 one of the aircraft was subjected to ground tests using an engine blower on the hangar apron. The V\u20131710 was run over a full range of speeds as different levels of water were injected into the blower and sprayed onto the engine. The other P\u201338J was flown at 10,000 feet altitude with water sprayed into the engine to simulate rain.

The AWT was run during night hours so that its massive power loads were handled when regional electric demands were lowest. At the time the AWT was among the most complex wind tunnels ever designed. In order to simulate conditions at high altitudes, NACA engineers designed innovative new systems that required tremendous amounts of electricity. The NACA had an agreement with the local electric company that it would run its larger facilities overnight when local demand was at its lowest. In return the utility discounted its rates for the NACA during those hours.       The AWT could produce wind speeds up to 500 miles per hour through its 20-foot-diameter test section at the standard operating altitude of 30,000 feet. The airflow was created by a large fan that was driven by an 18,000-horsepower General Electric induction motor. The altitude simulation was accomplished by large exhauster and refrigeration systems. The cold temperatures were created by 14 Carrier compressors and the thin atmosphere by four 1750-horsepower exhausters.    The first and second shifts usually set up and broke down the test articles, while the third shift ran the actual tests.
