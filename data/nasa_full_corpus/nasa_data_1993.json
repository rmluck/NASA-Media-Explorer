The STS-61 mission was the first of the series of the HST servicing missions. Two months after its deployment in space, scientists detected a 2-micron spherical aberration in the primary mirror of the HST that affected the telescope's ability to focus faint light sources into a precise point. This imperfection was very slight, one-fiftieth of the width of a human hair. During four spacewalks, the STS-61 crew replaced the solar panel with its flexing problems; the WF/PC1 with WF/PC2, with built-in corrective optics; and the High-Speed Photometer with the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) to correct the aberration for the remaining instruments. The purpose of the HST, the most complex and sensitive optical telescope ever made, is to study the cosmos from a low-Earth orbit for 15 years or more. The HST provides fine detail imaging, produces ultraviolet images and spectra, and detects very faint objects. The Marshall Space Flight Center had responsibility for design, development, and construction of the HST. The Perkin-Elmer Corporation, in Danbury, Cornecticut, developed the optical system and guidance sensors.", "keywords": ["STS-61", "Hubble Space Telescope", "HST", "Wide Field/Planetary Camera", "WF/PC"], "center": "MSFC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1993-12-01T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/9400368/9400368~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/9400368/9400368~thumb.jpg"}

Sandstone, shale and chert (similar to flint) deposited in a sea several thousand feet deep were squeezed up to form the mountains about 250 million years ago.

Clouds formed by upslope winds border both the north and south sides of one of the most dramatic plunging synclines (in a syncline the rock layers dip toward the center of the structure).

The radar antenna uses microwave energy which gives it the ability to collect data over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions.

In many cases, spaceborne radar is the only way scientists can explore large-scale and inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave wavelengths: L-Band (24 cm), C-Band (6 cm) and X-Ban (3 cm).  The multi-frequency data will be used by the international scientific community to monitor global environmental processes with a focus on climate change.

This desert extends from roughly Arica in the north to the city of Caldera in the south, a distance of six hundred miles.  Some parts of this very arid region go for more than twenty years without measurable precipitation.  It is an area of dramatic and abrupt elevation changes.  For example, from the waters edge there is an escarpment of the coastal plateau that rises like an unbroken wall two or three thousand feet above the Pacific Ocean.  From the coastal plateau, there is an even more dramatic increase in elevation -- from two thousand feet above sea level to an average elevation of thirteen thousand feet above sea level in the Bolivian Altiplano.  This elevation change occurs within a one hundred to two hundred mile distance from the Pacific Ocean.  The north-south trending spine of the Andes Mountains can be seen on this photograph.  Several of the volcanic peaks in this mountain chain exceed 20,000 feet above sea level.  Interspersed with these volcanic peaks, numerous dry lake beds (salars) can be seen as highly reflective surfaces.  The largest of these salars (Salar de Uyuni) is visible at the edge of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

LITE-1 is a lidar (light detection and ranging) system that uses a three-wavelength laser, symbolized by the three gold rays emanating from the star in the payload bay that form part of the astronaut symbol. The major objective of this first flight of LITE-1 is to validate its design and operating characteristics by gathering data about the Earth's troposphere and stratosphere, represented by the clouds and dual-colored Earth limb. A secondary payload on STS-64 is the free-flier SPARTAN-201 satellite shown on the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm post-retrieval. The objective of SPARTAN-201 is to investigate the physics of the solar wind and complement data being obtained from the ULYSSES satellite launched on STS-41. The RMS will also operate another secondary payload, Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX), which will assess the plume effects from the Orbiter's Reaction Control System thrusters. Additionally, STS-64 will test a new extravehicular activity (EVA) maneuvering device, Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER), represented symbolically by the two small nozzles on the backpacks of the two untethered EVA crew men.

The light is analyzed by various instruments and, according to the crew members, \"brings to us on Earth knowledge about planets, stars, galaxies and other celestial objects, allowing us to better understand the complex physical processes at work in the universe.\" The space shuttle Endeavour is also represented as the fundamental tool that allows the crew to perform the first servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope so its scientific deep space mission may be extended for several years to come. The overall design of the emblem, with lines converging to a high point, is also a symbolic representation of the large-scale Earth-based effort -- which involves space agencies, industry and the universities -- to reach goals of knowledge and perfection.    The NASA insignia design for space shuttle flights is reserved for use by the astronauts and for other official use as the NASA Administrator may authorize.

Many of the Greek islands can be seen in the Aegean Sea (top left), off the coast of Asia Minor. Cyprus is visible under atmospheric dust in the northeast corner of the Mediterranean. The dust cloud covers the east end of the Mediterranean, its western edge demarcated by a line that cuts the center of the Nile Delta. This dust cloud originated far to the west, in Algeria, and moved northeast over Sicily, southern Italy, and Greece.  Part of the cloud then moved on over the Black Sea, but another part swerved southward back towards Egypt. A gyre of clouds in the southeast corner of the Mediterranean indicates a complementary counterclockwise (cyclonic) circulation of air. The Euphrates River appears as a thin green line (upper right) in the yellow Syrian Desert just south of the blue-green mountains of Turkey. The Dead Sea (lower right) lies in a rift valley which extends north into Turkey and south thousands of miles down the Gulf of Aqaba, the Red Sea, and on through East Africa. The straight international boundary between Israel and Egypt (where the coastline angles) is particularly clear in this view, marked by the thicker vegetation on the Israeli side of the border. The green delta of the Nile River appears in the foreground, with the great conurbation of Cairo seen as a gray area at the apex of the triangle. Most of Egypt's 52 million inhabitants live in the delta. On the east side of the delta, the Suez Canal is visible. On the western corner of the delta lies the ancient city of Alexandria, beside the orange and white salt pans.

Lake Masada, the dark waterlogged area to the west (left) of Port Said is becoming more saline as the Aswan Dam has reduced sediment downstream. This sediment reduction, according to NASA scientists studying the STS-56 photography, has resulted in increased coastal erosion and the intrusion of a salt-water lens to the ground water, particularly in the northeastern portions of the delta. Center pivot irrigation fields are located along either side of the Ramses Canal, which connects the Daimietta Nile with Great Bitter Lake. This canal has been re-dug three or four times in the past 3,000 years. Historians note that the canal's most famous use was as the departure point of the fleet of Pharaoh Necho.

Viewed with the Earth's limb top left, clouds at bottom, the view direction is west and north top right.  The Cape of Good Hope, with Cape Town nearby, is the thin spike beyond.  The great bay in the foreground is Algoa Bay with the city of Port Elizabeth.  This was the first time European voyagers are known to have rounded the Cape of Good Hope in their quest to reach India by sea.  The entire fold mountain belt of southern Africa is visible: these mountains appear as green (forested) wavy structures stretching west form the foreground, to the Cape of Good Hope, and then northwards some distance.  One theory about their origin is that the Falkland Plateau, now an undersea extension of South America, was jostled up against Africa more than 150 million years ago, in times before the Atlantic Ocean existed, before Africa and South America drifted apart from one another.  The jostling caused the evolution of the fold mountain belt.", "keywords": ["AFRICA", "COASTS", "BAYS", "MOUNTAINS", "EARTH OBSERVATIONS (FROM SPACE)", "STS-58", "ONBOARD ACTIVITIES", "COLUMBIA (ORBITER)", "EARTH LIMB"], "center": "JSC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1993-10-30T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts058-77-083/sts058-77-083~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/sts058-77-083/sts058-77-083~thumb.jpg"}
