Researchers at NACA Lewis began postulating about the use of atomic power for propulsion immediately after World War II.

The military studied the plausibility of nuclear propulsion for aircraft in the late 1940s. The military program was cancelled after four years without any breakthroughs, but the Atomic Energy Commission took on the effort in 1951.    The NACA Lewis laboratory was expanding its nuclear-related research during this period. In 1948, Lewis engineers were assigned to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to obtain expertise in high temperature heat transfer and advanced materials technology. The following year a new 80-person Nuclear Reactor Division was created, and an in-house nuclear school was established to train these researchers. The cyclotron was built behind the Materials and Structures Laboratory to support thermodynamic and materials research for both nuclear aircraft and nuclear rockets.    The original NACA Lewis cyclotron was used to accelerate two kinds of particles. To better match the space radiation environment, the cyclotron was later modified to accelerate particles of the newly-discovered Van Allen radiation belts.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1951-02-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1951-C-27209/GRC-1951-C-27209~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1951-C-27209/GRC-1951-C-27209~thumb.jpg"}

Silverstein led the group on a tour of Lewis\u2019 new 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel where the Duke inquired about the operation of the facility\u2019s flexible walls, the types of components tested, and the generation of airflow.     The Duke was in town in 1951 to promote his new autobiography, A King\u2019s Story, at the American Booksellers Convention. Edward had assumed the British throne in January 1936, only to renounce the position less than a year later to controversially marry Wallis Simpson. Ongoing concerns over the couple\u2019s relationship to the German government resulted in his World War II assignment to the Bahamas.

These pieces would serve as the two 14-foot diameter test chambers in the new Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL). NACA Lewis specialized in aircraft engines and offered many engine test facilities. In the late 1940s, however, the NACA realized a larger facility was required to test the newest jet engines. When completed in October 1952, PSL became the nation\u2019s most powerful facility for testing full-scale engines at simulated flight altitudes.     NACA engineers began designing the PSL in 1947, and excavations commenced in September 1949. In the spring of 1950, the facility\u2019s supports were erected, and the two large exhaust gas coolers were installed. Work on the Access Building began in early 1951 with the arrival of the large test section pieces, seen in this photograph. The massive pieces were delivered to the area from the Henry Pratt Company by rail and then loaded on a series of flatbed trucks that transported them to Lewis. The nearest vehicle has one of the clamshell access hatches.     PSL was initially used to study the jet engines of the early 1950s and ramjets for missile programs such as Navaho and Bomarc. With the advent of the space program in the late 1950s, the facility was used to investigate complex rocket engines, including the Pratt and Whitney RL-10.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1951-01-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1951-C-26974/GRC-1951-C-26974~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1951-C-26974/GRC-1951-C-26974~thumb.jpg"}

The Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory was renamed in Lewis\u2019 honor in September 1948. Lewis served as the NACA\u2019s Director of Aeronautical Research for over 20 years.      Lewis joined the NACA as Executive Officer in 1919 and was named Director of Aeronautical Research in 1924. In this role Lewis served as the liaison between the Executive Committee and the research laboratories. His most important accomplishment may have been the investigative tours of German research facilities in 1936 and 1939. The visits resulted in the NACA\u2019s physical expansion and the broadening of its scope of research. Lewis did not take a day of leave between the Pearl Harbor attack and the Armistice, but began suffering health problems in 1945. He was forced to retire two years later and passed in July 1948.

When it began operation in late 1952, the Propulsion Systems Laboratory was the NACA\u2019s most powerful facility for testing full-scale engines at simulated flight altitudes. The facility contained two altitude simulating test chambers which were a technological combination of the static sea-level test stands and the complex Altitude Wind Tunnel, which recreated actual flight conditions on a larger scale.    NACA Lewis began designing the new facility in 1947 as part of a comprehensive plan to improve the altitude testing capabilities across the lab. The exhaust, refrigeration, and combustion air systems from all the major test facilities were linked. In this way, different facilities could be used to complement the capabilities of one another. Propulsion Systems Laboratory construction began in late summer 1949 with the installation of an overhead exhaust pipe connecting the facility to the Altitude Wind Tunnel and Engine Research Building.
