General Electric\u2019s first attempt, the I-A, was fraught with problems. The design was improved somewhat with the subsequent I-16 engine.  It was not until the engine's next reincarnation as the I-40 in 1943 that General Electric\u2019s efforts paid off. The 4000-pound thrust I-40 was incorporated into the Lockheed Shooting Star airframe and successfully flown in June 1944. The Shooting Star became the US\u2019s first successful jet aircraft and the first US aircraft to reach 500 miles per hour.    NACA Lewis studied all of General Electric\u2019s centrifugal turbojet models during the 1940s. In 1945 the entire Shooting Star aircraft was investigated in the Altitude Wind Tunnel. Engine compressor performance and augmentation by water injection; comparison of different fuel blends in a single combustor; and air-cooled rotors were studied.   The mechanic in this photograph watches the firing of a full-scale I-40 in the Jet Propulsion Static Laboratory.

Extensive wind tunnel and test stand studies were augmented by actual flight tests.     Lewis engineers modified this B\u201229 so that the ramjet could be stored in the bomb bay. Once the aircraft reached the desired altitude and speed, a mechanical arm suspended the ramjet 52 inches below the bomb bay. The ramjet\u2019s angle-of-attack could be independently adjusted, and a periscope permitted a view of the test article from inside the aircraft. Researchers took measurements in free-stream conditions at speeds up to Mach 0.51 and at altitudes ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 feet. They then shut the ramjet down and retracted it into the aircraft.    The researchers first determined that 14,000 feet was the maximum altitude at which the engine could be ignited by spark. They used flares to start the engine at altitudes up to 30,000 feet.  They were able to determine maximum combustion efficiencies, response time to changes in fuel flow, and minimum fuel-air ratios.

In late 1945 the NACA began design work for new large supersonic wind tunnels at its three laboratories. The result was the 4- by 4-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, 6- by 6-foot supersonic wind tunnel at Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and the largest facility, the 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel in Cleveland. The two former tunnels were to study aerodynamics, while the 8- by 6 facility was designed for supersonic propulsion.

In 1947 it was renamed the NACA Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory to reflect the expansion of the research activities beyond just engines. Following the death of George Lewis, the name was changed to the NACA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in September 1948. On October 1, 1958, the lab was incorporated into the new NASA space agency, and it was renamed the NASA Lewis Research Center. Following John Glenn\u2019s flight on the space shuttle, the name was changed again to the NASA Glenn Research Center on March 1, 1999.  From his office in Washington DC, George Lewis managed the aeronautical research conducted at the NACA for over 20 years.

One facet of this program was the investigation of the effects of icing on turbojets. Although jet engines allowed aircraft to pass through inclement weather at high rates of speed, ice accumulation was still a concern. The NACA\u2019s B-24M Liberator was initially reconfigured with a General Electric I-16 engine installed in the aircraft\u2019s waist compartment with an air scoop and spray nozzles to produce the artificial icing conditions. The centrifugal engine appeared nearly impervious to the effects of icing.    Axial-flow jet engines, however, were much more susceptible to icing damage. The inlet guide vanes were particularly vulnerable, but the cowling\u2019s leading edge, the main bearing supports, and accessory housing could also ice up. If pieces of ice reached the engine\u2019s internal components, the compressor blades could be damaged. To study this phenomenon, a Westinghouse 24C turbojet, seen in this photograph, was installed under the B-24M\u2019s right wing.    In January 1948 flight tests of the 24C in icing conditions began. Despite ice buildup into the second stage of the compressor, the engine was able to operate at takeoff speeds. Researchers found the ice on the inlet vanes resulted in half of the engine\u2019s decreased performance.", "keywords": [], "center": "GRC", "media_type": "image", "date_created": "1948-11-23T00:00:00Z", "location": "", "photographer": "", "secondary_creator": "", "album": [], "asset": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1948-C-22589/GRC-1948-C-22589~orig.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/GRC-1948-C-22589/GRC-1948-C-22589~thumb.jpg"}
